\chapter{Passage of particles through matter}

This is a fairly succinct recap of the basic facts concering the passage of
particles through matter. The reader will find more in depth information
in~\cite{PDG} and reference therein. We emphasize that the importance of the
material covered in this section is pervasive within this writeup, as it is
equally important in context as different as the acceleration of cosmic rays,
their propagation and their detection.


\section{Charged particles: energy losses}

Energy losses of charged particles are customarily discussed separately for
heavy\sidenote{In this context by \emph{heavy} we really mean anything much
heavier than an electron.} (e.g., protons, alpha particles and nuclei) and light
(e.g. electrons) particles---the reason behind that being that radiation losses
are, generally speaking, negligible for the the former. Given that, in principle, all
particles---be they heavy or light---suffer both ionization and radiation
losses, here we take a slightly different approach, focusing our discussion,
at the top level, on the distinction between these two types of losses.


\subsection{Ionization losses}

Relativistic charged heavy particles passing through matter loose energy by
ionization at an average rate that is reasonably well described by the Bethe
equation over most of energies we are interested. Numerical factor aside, this
reads
\begin{align}\label{eq:stopping_power}
  -\ave{\frac{dE}{dx}}_\text{ion} \!\!\!\!\!\!
  \propto z^2 \frac{Z}{A}\frac{1}{\beta^2}
  \left[ \frac{1}{2} \ln(C_0 \beta^2\gamma^2) - \beta^2 +
    \text{corrections} \right],
\end{align}
where $Z$ and $A$ refer to the target material and $z$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$
refer to the projectile. (The readed can refer to~\cite{PDG} for a detailed
description of all the terms in the equation).

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/muon_ionization_loss.pgf}
  \caption{Muon ionization loss in silicon as a function of the particle momentum
    (adapted from~\cite{PDG}). The vertical dashed line indicates the minimum of
    the ionization (in this specific case at $p \sim 363$~MeV/c, or
    $\beta\gamma \sim 3.44$) separating the two regimes where the energy loss
    scales as $\nicefrac{1}{E}$ and $\log E$, respectively.}
  \label{fig:muon_ionization_loss}
\end{marginfigure}

Basically the energy loss per unit length is proportional to the $Z/A$ ratio of
the target material and the square of the charge $z$ of the incident particle.
When the latter is slow ($\beta \ll 1$) the energy losses decrease as
$1/\beta^2 \propto 1/E$ as $\beta$ increases. In the ultra-relativistic regime
($\beta \approx 1$) the losses increase as $\ln \gamma^2 \propto \ln E$, which
generally goes under the name of relativistic (or logarithmic) rise.
When plotted as a function of the momentum of the incident particle, the ionization
energy-loss curve has the typical shape shown in figure~\ref{fig:muon_ionization_loss},
with a relatively broad minimum at $\beta\gamma \sim 3$, where $dE/dx$ (normalized
to the density of the target) is of the order of 1--2~MeV~g$^{-1}$~cm$^{2}$.
A particle with the energy corresponding to this minimum ionization is customarily
called a \emph{minimum ionizing particle} (MIP).

We note for completeness that, since ionization losses are fundamentally due to
interactions between the incoming particle and the atomic electrons of the
medium, there are significant kinematic differences between the two cases of
heavy and light projectiles. In addition to that, quantum-mechanical effects due
to the fact that the projectile and the target are identical particles come
into play in case of electrons, but we won't insist any further on the subject.


\subsection{Radiation losses and critical energy}

At sufficiently high energy any charged particle passing through matter emits
electromagnetic radiation, most notably via \bremss\ in the field of the
atomic nuclei of the target material---although there are other physical processes
contributing, as explained in detail in~\cite{2001ADNDT..78..183G}.

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/muon_stopping_power.pgf}
  \caption{Muon stopping power in silicon as a function of the particle momentum
    (adapted from~\cite{PDG}). The two dashed lines indicate the ionization losses
    (also shown in figure~\ref{fig:muon_ionization_loss}) and the radiation
    losses. The energy at which the two cross each other is the critical energy,
    which is in this specific case is 580~GeV.}
  \label{fig:muon_stopping_power}
\end{marginfigure}

To first order radiation losses are proportional to the energy of the radiating
particle
\begin{align}\label{eq:rad_losses}
  -\left<\frac{dE}{dx}\right>_\text{rad} \!\!\!\!\!\! \propto \frac{Z^2}{m^2} E
\end{align}
and, since ionization losses only grow logarithmically, the two loss rates, when
seen as function of energy, are bound to cross each other at some point, as shown
in figure~\ref{fig:muon_stopping_power}. The energy $E_c$ at which this
happens is called \emph{critical energy}. Since radiation losses scale as $1/m^2$,
for any given material $E_c$ is different for different particles---and it is
much higher for heavier particles. For reference, the critical energy in silicon
is $\sim 40$~MeV for electrons, $\sim 580$~GeV for muons, and in the tens to
hundreds of TeV for protons. (We do note explicitly that, in any given material,
the critical energies for electrons and positrons are, in general, slightly different,
but this will not bear any real consequence in this context.)

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/critical_energy.pgf}
  \caption{Approximate critical energy~\eqref{eq:critical_energy} for elements as
    a function of the atomic number. (The solid line is for solids, while the
    dashed one is for gases.)}
  \label{fig:critical_energy}
\end{marginfigure}

To most practical purposes radiation losses are only relevant for electrons
(and positrons) and it is customary to refer to the critical energy for electrons
as \emph{the} critical energy. A popular empirical approximation for $E_c$ as a
function of the atomic number of the material is
\begin{align}\label{eq:critical_energy}
  E_c =
  \begin{cases}
    \displaystyle\frac{610}{Z + 1.24}~\text{MeV}\quad\text{for solids}\\[8pt]
    \displaystyle\frac{710}{Z + 0.92}~\text{MeV}\quad\text{for gases}
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
as shown in figure~\ref{fig:critical_energy}.


\subsection{The radiation length}%
\label{sec:radiation_length}

Above the critical energy, i.e., in the regime where radiation losses dominate,
equation~\eqref{eq:rad_losses} can readily integrated for a homogeneous material,
yielding the electron energy as a function of the distance $x$ traversed:
\begin{align}
  E(x) = E_0 \exp\left(-\frac{x}{X_0}\right).
\end{align}
The quantity $X_0$, representing the typical length over which an electron looses
all but $1/e$ of its energy due to \bremss, is called \emph{radiation length} and
is characteristic of the material. The radiation length is conveniently expressed
in g~cm$^{-2}$, i.e., factoring out the density of the medium, and a popular
parametrization is
\begin{align}
  X_0 = \frac{716~A}{Z(Z + 1) \ln\frac{287}{\sqrt{Z}}}~\text{g~cm}^{-2}.
\end{align}
Table~\ref{tab:exp_radlen} shows numerical values for a few materials of interest.

\begin{table}[htb!]
  \begin{tabular}{p{0.21\linewidth}p{0.21\linewidth}p{0.21\linewidth}%
      p{0.21\linewidth}}
    \hline
    Material & $X_0$~[g~cm$^{-2}$] & $\density$ [g~cm$^{-3}$] & $X_0$ [cm]\\
    \hline
    \hline
    Pb & 6.37 & 11.350 & 0.561\\
    BGO & 7.97 & 7.130 & 1.12\\
    CsI & 8.39 & 4.510 & 1.86\\
    W & 6.76 & 19.3 & 0.350\\
    C (graphite) & 42.70 & 2.210 & 19.3\\
    Si & 21.82 & 2.329 & 9.37\\
    Air & 36.62 & $1.2 \times 10^{-3}$ & 30,500\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Tabulated values of the radiation length for some materials of
    interest.}
  \label{tab:exp_radlen}
\end{table}

The radiation length is the natural scale for all the most relevant
electromagnetic phenomena we shall deal with in the following: multiple
scattering, electron \bremss, pair production and electromagnetic
showers. We shall customarily indicate with the letter $t = x/X_0$ any
distance measured in units of $X_0$.


\subsection{Multiple Coulomb scattering}%
\label{sec:inter_mcs}

A charged particle traversing a medium undergoes multiple Coulomb scatterings
on the atomic nuclei of the material. In the so-called gaussian approximation
the root mean square of the deviation angle projected in any of the planes
containing the incoming particle direction can be parameterized as
\begin{align}\label{eq:theta_ms}
  \theta^\text{rms}_\text{plane} =
  \frac{13.6~\text{MeV}}{\beta c p}z\sqrt{t} (1 + 0.038 \ln t)~\text{rad},
\end{align}
where $\beta c$, $p$ and $z$ are the velocity, momentum and charge number
of the incoming particle, and $t$ is the thickness of the traversed
material in units of radiation lengths.

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/multiple_scattering.pgf}
  \caption{Multiple scattering angle in the plane from~\eqref{eq:theta_ms} as a
    function of momentum for $t = 1\%~X_0$ and $t = 10\%~X_0$. The solid (dashed)
    line indicates the curve for electrons (protons).}
  \label{fig:multiple_scattering}
\end{marginfigure}

The deflection space angle being the sum in quadrature of the independent
deflections on two orthogonal planes, it is simply given by
\begin{align}
  \theta^\text{rms}_\text{space} = \sqrt{2}\theta^\text{rms}_\text{plane}.
\end{align}
Whether one or the other is more relevant depends on the problem at hand
(e.g., typically the pointing accuracy of a detector is parameterized in terms
of the space angle, but in a magnetic spectrometer the important figure is
really the deflection angle in the bending plane).


\section{Photons}%
\label{sec:inter_gammas}

High-energy photon interaction with matter involves essentially three distinct physical
processes, each dominant in a different energy range.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
  \input{figures/photon_xsec.pgf}
  \caption{Photon interaction cross section in silicon. The dashed lines indicate
    the three dominant process: photoelectric absorption, Compton scattering and
    pair production. The contribution from the coherent scattering on the atoms
    of the material, which is subdominant at all energies, is included in the total
    but not shown separately.}
  \label{fig:photon_xsec}
\end{figure}

At low energy\sidenote{If we are adamant in stating a number, here, we might say
that the photoelectric effect dominates below $\sim 10$~keV, but this is highly
dependent on the atomic number of the absorbing material.} the interaction process
with the largest cross section is the photoelectric effect, where the photon is
absorbed by an atom and an electron is emitted in its place. As it turns out, this
is a complicated process, preferentially involving the atomic electrons of the
inner orbitals, where the atom is left in an excited state and subsequently relaxes
via the emission of another electron (the so-called Auger electron) or a fluorescence
photon. The photoelectric cross section scales rather violently with both the
atomic number $Z$ of the target material and the photon energy $E$
\begin{align}
  \sigma_\text{photoelectric} \propto
  \begin{cases}
    \displaystyle\frac{Z^4}{E^3} \quad\text{at low energy}\\[8pt]
    \displaystyle\frac{Z^5}{E} \quad\text{at high energy}
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
with dramatic resonances (of the order of 10\%) in correspondence of the energies
of the atomic orbitals.

At intermediate energies (roughly speaking around a MeV) the dominant photon
interaction process is the Compton scattering off (quasi-free) atomic electrons
\begin{align}
  \gamma \; e^- \rightarrow \gamma \; e^-.
\end{align}
This is an inelastic process where the photon transfer part of its energy to the
electron and, in general, changes its direction. Since the atomic electrons are
seen incoherently, the total cross section
\begin{align}
  \sigma_\text{Compton} \propto Z
\end{align}
is proportional to the atomic number of the target material.

Very high-energy photons (above a few tens of MeV) interact with matter mainly by
pair production in the field of atomic nuclei (although pair production off
atomic electrons also play a subdominant role). Like the photoelectric effect, this
is a destructive process, where the photon disappear and (in this case) an
electron-positron pair materializes instead. From a kinematic point of view,
this is a threshold process, with a minimum energy of $2 m_e c^2 = 1.022$~MeV
in the case of pair production off nuclei and $4 m_e c^2 = 2.044$~MeV in the
case of electrons. The total cross section
\begin{align}
  \sigma_\text{pair} \propto Z(Z + 1) \approx Z^2
\end{align}
is asymptotically constant at high energy and proportional to the square of the
atomic number of the target material.


\subsection{Pair production}

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/em_shower_feynman.pgf}
  \caption{Feynman diagram at tree level for the electron \bremss\ (top) and pair
  production by gamma rays in the field of an atomic nucleus. The two only differ
  for the exchange of the top external legs.}
  \label{fig:em_shower_feynman}
\end{marginfigure}

As it turns out, the processes of electron \bremss\ and pair production are intimately
related to each other, as the underlying tree-level Feynman diagrams for the two
cases tranform into each other via the swap of a single external leg. More specifically,
the scattering matrix element for the two processes is identical, and the only
different is the phase-space term, due to the fact that the kinematic of the final
state is different. As a result, the mean free path for pair production for a
high-energy photon is related to the radiation length of the material
\begin{align}\label{eq:lambda_pair}
  \lambda_\text{pair} = \frac{9}{7}X_0
\end{align}
(i.e., it is $9/7$ of the scale length over which a high-energy electron
looses all but $1/e$ of its energy).

It should be noted that, while pair production is a destructive process
(the gamma-ray no longer exists afterwards), \bremss\ only degrades the
electron energy. As we shall see in a second, these two physical processes are
at the base of the development of electromagnetic showers.


\section{Electromagnetic showers}%
\label{sec:em_showers}

As explained in the previous section, high-energy electrons and photons
produce in matter secondary photons by \bremss\ and electron-positron
pairs by pair production. These secondaries, in turn, can produce other
particles with progressively lower energy and start an
\emph{electromagnetic shower} (or \emph{cascade}).
The process continue until the average energy of the electron component falls
below the critical energy of the material---at which point the rest of the
energy is released via ionization.

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/em_shower_naive.pgf}
  \caption{Sketch of the development of an electron-induced electromagnetic shower
  in the simplest possible toy model.}
  \label{fig:em_shower_naive}
\end{marginfigure}

A simple toy model for an electron-initiated shower is schematically represented
in figure~\ref{fig:em_shower_naive}, where after $t$ radiation lengths of material,
the cascade has developed in $2^t$ particles (a mix of electrons, positrons and
photons, roughly in equal proportions) with an average energy of $\nicefrac{E_0}{2^t}$.
The process continue until the latter reach the critical energy in the medium,
at which point radiation losses become subdominant and the remaining energy
degradation proceed by ionization.
It goes without saying that this naive schematization is neglecting many of the
salient features of the development of a real shower: the intrinsic stochasticity
of the process, the the $\nicefrac{9}{7}$ term in~\eqref{eq:lambda_pair}, the fact
that the electron can---and does---radiate multiple photons of different energy
per radiation length, and the ionization losses, which are at play even when the
radiation losses dominate. And yet, rough as this model is, it is able to reproduce
one of the main features of electromagnetic showers, namely the fact that the
position of the shower maximum scales logarithmically with the energy. In fact the
stop condition reads
\begin{align}
  \frac{E_0}{2^{t_\text{max}}} \approx E_c
  \quad\text{or}\quad
  t_\text{max} \approx \ln \left(\frac{E_0}{E_c}\right).
\end{align}

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/shower_longitudinal_profile.pgf}
  \caption{Average longitudinal profile of the shower generated by a
     $100$~GeV electron in a homogeneous slab of BGO.}
  \label{fig:shower_longitudinal_profile}
\end{marginfigure}

At a slightly higher level of sophistication, the longitudinal profile of an
electromagnetic shower can be effectively described as
\begin{align}\label{eq:long_profile}
  \frac{dE}{dt} = E_0 b \frac{(bt)^{a-1} e^{-bt}}{\Gamma(a)},
\end{align}
where $a$ and $b$ are parameters related to the nature of the incident particle
(electron or photon) and to the characteristics of the medium ($b = 0.5$
is a reasonable approximation in many cases of practical interest).
The position of the shower maximum occurs at
\begin{align}\label{eq:shower_max}
  t_\text{max} = \frac{(a - 1)}{b} \approx
  \ln \left(\frac{E_0}{E_c}\right) + t_0
\end{align}
where $t_0 = -0.5$ for electrons and $t_0 = 0.5$ for photons. For the sake
of clarity, the way one typically uses these relation is to plug $E_0$, $E_c$
and $t_0$ in \eqref{eq:shower_max} to find $a$ (assuming $b = 0.5$) and then
use~\eqref{eq:long_profile} to describe the longitudinal profile of the shower.

Figure~\ref{fig:shower_longitudinal_profile} shows the average shower profile for
$100$~GeV in BGO. With a critical energy of $10.1$~MeV, the position of the shower
maximum is located, according to equation~\eqref{eq:shower_max}, at $8.7~X_0$.

We mention, in passing, that the transverse development of an electromagnetic
shower, mainly due to the multiple scattering of electrons and positrons away
from the shower axis, scales with the so-called the Moli\`ere radius, that can be
empirically parameterized as
\begin{align}
  R_M \approx X_0 \frac{E_s}{E_c}
  \quad\text{where}\quad
  E_s = 21~\text{MeV}.
\end{align}


\section{Hadronic showers}%
\label{sec:had_showers}

While the development of electromagnetic showers is determined, as we have seen,
by two well-understood QED processes, the energy degradation of hadrons proceeds
through both strong and electromagnetic interactions in the medium. The complexity
of the hadronic and nuclear processes produce a multitude of phenomena that make
hadronic showers intrinsically more complicated than the electromagnetic ones.
In other words for hadronic showers there is no such a thing as the toy model
illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:em_shower_naive}.

As a matter of fact hadronic showers consist in general of two distinctly different
components: (i) an electromagnetic component due to $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ generated
in the absorption process and decaying into photons (which in turn develop
electromagnetic showers) before they have a chance to undergo a new strong interaction;
and (ii) a non-electromagnetic component, which combines essentially everything
else that takes place in the absorption process. Most importantly, the two components
evolve with different length scales: the radiation length $X_0$ for the first and
the nuclear interaction length $\lambda_I$ for the second.

Interestingly enough, one can gain some useful insight into the latter by simple
semi-quantitative arguments based on dimensional analysis. Since the volume of the
nucleus is proportional to the mass number $A$, its radius will be
\begin{align*}
  r \approx r_0 A^\frac{1}{3}
  \quad\text{where}\quad
  r_0 \approx 10^{-15}~\text{m} = 1~\text{fm}.
\end{align*}
Now, since nuclear interactions are governed by the strong force, which is
characterized by a short range, the nuclear cross section approaches the geometrical
limit
\begin{align*}
  \sigma_N \propto r^2 \propto A^\frac{2}{3},
\end{align*}
and the corresponding interaction length (measured in~cm) can be written in terms
of $\sigma_N$ and the number density $n$ of the nuclei\sidenote{Mind that, since
$\sigma_N$ is the cross section of the nucleus, $n$ is  the number density of the
\emph{nuclei} and not that of the \emph{nucleons}. As such, it scales with the
theromidinamic properties of the medium, but does not depend on the mass number
$A$.} as
\begin{align*}
  \lambda_I = \frac{1}{n \sigma_N} = \frac{A}{N_A \density \sigma_N}\propto
  \begin{cases}
    \displaystyle A^{-\frac{2}{3}} \quad\text{in~cm}\\
    \displaystyle A^\frac{1}{3} \quad\text{in~g~cm}^{-2}.
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}

A useful parameterization for $\lambda_I$, that can be used for actual calculations,
is in fact
\begin{align}\label{eq:param_intlen}
  \lambda_I = 37.8~A^{0.312}~\text{g~cm}^{-2}
\end{align}
and the tabulated values for some relevant materials are shown in
table~\ref{tab:exp_intlen}.

%(which is at least on order of magnitude larger for $Z > 30$, as
%shown in figure~\ref{fig:rad_int_len}) .

\end{table}

The fractional non-electromagnetic component of a hadronic shower $F_h$ (as
opposed to electromagnetic component $F_e = 1 - F_h$) decreases with energy and
is generally~\cite{PDG} parameterized as
\begin{align}
  F_h(E) = \left( \frac{E}{E_0} \right)^{k-1},
\end{align}
where typical values are $E_0 \approx 1$~GeV and $k \approx 0.8$ (roughly
speaking, the fraction of energy the non-electromagnetic component accounts
for is of the order of $50\%$ at $100$~GeV and $30\%$ at $1$~TeV).

In broad terms, hadronic showers tend to start developing at relatively large
depths in the material and they are typically larger and more irregular when
compared with electromagnetic showers. All these differences are customarily used
in modern space-based imaging calorimeters for particle identification.


\section{\Cheren\ radiation}%
\label{sec:cherenkov_rad}

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/cherenkov_effect.pgf}
  \caption{Sketch of the \Cheren\ effect. When a particle moves at a speed that
  exceeds the speed of the light in the medium, the radiation adds up coherently
  to generate a wavefront.}
  \label{fig:cherenkov_effect}
\end{marginfigure}

\Cheren\ radiation is emitted when a charged particle moves in a medium at a speed
greater than the speed of light \emph{in that medium}
\begin{align}
  \beta > \frac{1}{n}.
\end{align}
(Here $\beta$ refers to the incident particle and $n$ is the index of
refraction of the material.) In the ideal case of a non-dispersive medium, the
Cherencov wave front form an acute angle with respect to the particle velocity
given by
\begin{align}
  \cos\theta_c = \frac{1}{n\beta}
\end{align}
as sketched in figure~\ref{fig:cherenkov_effect}.

The (double differential) spectrum of the photons produced per unit path length
and wavelength is given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:cherenkov_loss}
  \frac{d^2N}{dxd\lambda} = \frac{2\pi\alpha z^2}{\lambda^2}
  \left(1 -  \frac{1}{\beta^2 n^2(\lambda)}\right) =
  \frac{2\pi\alpha z^2}{\lambda^2}
  \left(1 - \frac{1 + \beta^2\gamma^2}{\beta^2\gamma^2n^2(\lambda)}\right),
\end{align}
where $z$ is the charge of the projectile, and the index of refraction $n$
is evaluated at the generic photon wavelength $\lambda$.
Equation~\eqref{eq:cherenkov_loss} cannot be readily translated into a detector
signal as, in practice, one has to convolve it with the response of the
transducer and integrate over the photon wavelengths of interest.
