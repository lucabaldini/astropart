\chapter{The Hitchhiker's guide to the universe}
\label{chap:universe}


One of the main features of the material covered in this writeup is its eclecticism,
along with the variety of scales we shall explore along diverse dynamical axes.
Some of the objects we shall encounters are relevant in various ways in different
contexts---supernov\ae~are a prime example we shall discuss in the context of the
cosmic-distance ladder, the problem of cosmic-ray acceleration, that of neutrino
production the study of neutrino properties, as well as the measurement of the
cosmological parameters.

This chapter constitutes a succinct recognition of some of the objects populating
the universe we shall encounter in the following, with the goal of establishing
some basic orders of magnitude and developing a common dictionary.


\section{Measuring the universe}

  \caption{Basic units of measurements for length.}
\end{table}

Since in the following we shall be dealing with length scales ranging over some
45 orders of magnitude---from the proton radius up to the overall dimensions of
the visible universe, we start off with a brief overview of the various units we
shall be using, trying to gauge how it is even possible to establish a self-consistent
framework extending to distances to much larger than what we commonly experience
on Earth.

The \emph{astronomical unit} corresponds historically to the average distance
between the Earth and the Sun, and has been re-defined in 2012 to be exactly
$149,597,870,700 \approx 1.496 \times 10^{11}$~m.
The light year is the distance traveled by light in year and (since the speed of
light has been defined in 1983 to be exactly $299,792,458$~m~s$^{-1}$) has again
an exact value of $9,460,730,472,580,800$~m. The \emph{parsec} (pc) is defined
as the distance at which 1~astronomical unit subtends 1~arcsec, or
$3.0857 \times 10^{16}$~m, or $\approx 3.26$~lyr. (You should be able to work out
with no hesitation the magic number that turns an~au into a~pc. Hint: it is
$3600 \times \nicefrac{180}{\pi} \approx 2.06 \times 10^5$.)

Astronomical distances are customarily measured throughout a variety of techniques.
Within the solar system, modern radar ranging techniques allow to measure the relative
distances within object to an astonishing degree of precision---a part in a billion
or better. For relatively nearby stars, parallax measurement is the most
straightforward method: pioneered by Bessel and others in the first half of the
19-th century, it is nowadays a precision technique, with the Gaia space mission
measuring with a reasonable accuracy stars out to the Galactic center, at a distance
of about 10~kpc. The Hertzsprung-Russel diagram is a useful tool to gauge the distance
of stars within the Milky way, although this kind of measurements is prone to subtle
systematic effects due, e.g., to the light extinction. Beyond our galaxy main-sequence
stars are too faint to be measured accurately and standard candles such as Cepheid
variables and Type-Ia supernov\ae, which are relatively common and can be much brighter,
come to rescue. At even larger distances, the measurement of the cosmological redshift
is the prime technique in use. (And there is a number of alternative tools and methods
we do not mention here which, although limited in the number of objects the can
be applied to, are useful as independent cross-checks.)

All these different techniques are routinely stitched together and used in conjunction
to define what is generally referred to as the \emph{cosmic-distance ladder}.
In the rest of this chapter we shall briefly review these techniques and
familiarize ourselves with some of the objects we have mentioned in passing and
are relevant for some of the topics we shall deal with in much more detail in the
following.



\subsection{The astronomical unit}
\label{sec:astronomical_unit}

Kepler's laws provide a mean to build a fully-fledged scale model of the solar system,
where the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets are determined by their
periods---the latter being comparatively easy to measure to a very high accuracy.
The knowledge of numerical value of any single relevant scale length (e.g., the
distance of any of the planets from the Sun) allows to fully specify this
model and calculate the absolute position of any of the bodies in the solar system.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\input{figures/au_measurements.pgf}
	\caption{Historical evolution of the various measurements of the astronomical
  unit from 1600 to 1900 (adapted from~\cite{2001JAHH....4...15H}). The values
  on the $y$ axis are referred to the current value of $149,597,870,700$~m.
  The time span between 1625 and ca. 1750 is what is what~\cite{2001JAHH....4...15H}
  refers to as "the period of confusion", following the realization, by Kepler
  and others, that the classical value of 1150 Earth radii derived by Aristarchus
  in 280~BC was largely underestimated. In the second half of the nineteenth
  century the astronomical unit has come to be known to about 1\%, while
  modern radar ranging techniques allow to measure distances in the solar
  system to a few parts per million.}
\end{figure}

The quantity that, historically, has served the purpose of this reference scale
length is the \emph{astronomical unit} (au), originally conceived as the average
of the aphelion and the perihelion of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, and redefined
in 2012 to have the exact numerical value of $149,597,870,700$~m. As we shall see
in the next section, the astronomical units is also key to the determination of
the distance to the closest stars through the measurement of stellar parallax, and
is effectively the first step in the cosmic ladder.

A detailed account of the quest for the numerical value of the astronomical unit
is provided in~\cite{2001JAHH....4...15H}. Unlike other fundamental astronomical
quantities---such as the radius of the Earth and the distance between the Earth
and the Moon, which have been known to a good precision since ancient times---the
astronomical unit has a troubled story. Early measurements were grossly underestimated,
and for about 19 centuries the estimates by Aristarchus, Hipparchus and Ptolemy
(all of them some 20~times too small) were hardly questioned---Copernicus and Tycho
were still using them at the end of the sixteenth century. In the early seventeenth
century Johannes Kepler was one the first casting doubts on the accepted values,
starting a period of about 150~years of developments and ingenious new methods.
By 1750, the estimates for the astronomical units were within $\pm 5\%$ of the current
reference value.



\subsection{Stellar parallax}
\label{sec:parallax}

Although the idea of measuring star distances using the parallax dates back at
least to the ancient Greeks, and was explicitly mentioned in 1632 by Galileo
Galilei in his \emph{Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems}%
\sidenote{\emph{Perch'io non credo che le stelle siano sparse in una sferica
superficie, egualmente distanti da un centro, ma stimo che le loro lontananze da
noi siano talmente varie, che alcune ve ne possano esser 2 e 3 volte pi\`u remote
di alcune altre; talch\'e, quando si trovasse co'l telescopio qualche piccolissima
stella vicinissima ad alcuna delle maggiori, e che per\`o quella fusse altissima,
potrebbe accadere che qualche sensibil mutazione succedesse tra di loro,
rispondente a quella de i pianeti superiori.}
(Galileo, Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo.)},
early attempts at the measurement of the \emph{absolute} stellar
parallax~\cite{1975JRASC..69..222F} brought in fact the discovery of stellar
\emph{aberration}, that James Bradley correctly explained in 1727 as a combined
effect of the finite speed of light and the revolution of the Earth around the
Sun~\cite{1727RSPT...35..637B}.

It was not until the end of the 1830s that sensitive enough instrumentation became
available for the \emph{relative} stellar parallax to be unambiguously detected,
independently, by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel for 61~Cygni~\cite{1838MNRAS...4..152B},
Thomas Henderson for $\alpha$~Centauri~\cite{1839MNRAS...4..168H} and Otto Wilhelm
von Struve for $\alpha$~Lyrae~\cite{1837sdmm.book.....S, 1840AN.....17..177V}.

\begin{table}[htbp!]
  \begin{tabular}{lrr}
    \hline
    Star & Original estimate [as] & Current estimate [as]\\
    \hline
    \hline
    61~Cygni & $0.314 \pm 0.020$~\cite{1838MNRAS...4..152B} &
      $0.285995 \pm 0.000060$~\cite{2023A&A...674A...1G}\\
    $\alpha$~Centauri & $1.06 \pm 0.12$~\cite{1839MNRAS...4..168H} &
      $0.743 \pm 0.013$~\cite{2016A&A...586A..90P}\\
    $\alpha$~Lyrae & $0.125 \pm 0.055$~\cite{1837sdmm.book.....S} &
      $0.13023 \pm 0.00036$~\cite{2007A&A...474..653V}\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Comparison between the original parallax values measured for
    61~Cygni, $\alpha$~Centauri, and $\alpha$~Lyrae, and the currently
    accepted values.}
\end{table}

A recent reanalysis \cite{2020AN....341..860R} of some of the original data sets
provides an informed account on the spectacular difficulty of these early measurements,
demonstrating how all of them have stand the test of time. Bessel's measurement,
in particular, could be described in modern terms as a least-square fit to 183~independent
data points that the author performed (flawlessly) without the aid of a computer,
and being very much aware of the possible sources of systematic effects. In order
to put things in context, it is worth reminding that 0.3~as correspond to the angle
subtended by a coin at a distance of $\sim 7$~km.

In a time where the Gaia data release 3~\cite{2023A&A...674A...1G} contains the
full astrometry solution for almost 2~billions of stars out to magnitude of about
$G = 21$, with parallax errors as small as $20~\mu$as, this might seems nothing
short of romantic, but the consequences of these pioneering measurements can be
hardly downplayed, as for the first time in history a sensible estimate of the distance
to closest stars was available.



\subsection{Standard candles}
\label{dec:standard_candles}

One of the cornerstones in the development of the modern cosmic-distance ladder is
the realization, by Henrietta Swan Leavitt\sidenote{It is hard not to notice that
the original Harvard College Observatory circular~\cite{1912HarCi.173....1L} is
signed by the Director of the Observatory, Edward Pickering, since Henrietta, as
a woman, was not allowed to disseminate the result directly.}, of the existence of
a period-luminosity relation for a particular class of sources going under the name
of \emph{Cepheids}.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\input{figures/leavitt_1912.pgf}
	\caption{Original evidence for the relation between luminosity and period in
    Cepheid variables (adapted from~\cite{1912HarCi.173....1L}). The plot
    shows the measured brightness and period for 25 variable stars in the Small
    Magellanic Cloud---the black points represent the geometric mean of the
    minimum and maximum luminosity reported in the 1912 paper by Henrietta Swan Leavitt.
    In modern terms, the fit represent a power law with index $2.04 \pm 0.10$.
    Under the assumption that the stars lie all the same distance (which is not
    terrible, as the diameter of the LMC is roughly 10\% of its distance, 60~kpc,
    from the Earth) this represents the first evidence that specific source classes
    can be used as standard candles for distance measurements. It is also interesting
    to note how such a crude relation allows to recover the source distance
    from its period typically within $\sim 0.3$ magnitudes, i.e., a factor of of 2.}
	%\labfig{normalmonalisa}
\end{figure}

Named from the star Delta Cephei in the constellation Cepheus, Cepheids are
radially-pulsating, variable stars, whose magnitudes change with time with a relatively
regular pattern. Studying a sample of Cepheids in a Large Magellanic cloud, Leavitt
was the first to realize the presence of a tight correlation between the brightness
and the period\sidenote{Note the key to this measurement is the fact that we can
assume the stars in the LMC are all approximately at the same distance.} This, in
turn, paved the way to the indirect measurement of the distances of other galaxies
by the measurement of the period and the relative magnitude of Cepheid stars embedded
into them: you derive the absolute magnitude from the period and gauge the distance
via the inverse-square low by comparing it to the relative magnitude.

Cepheids constitute the first instance of so called \emph{standard candles}, or
objects whose absolute luminosity is known or can be reliably inferred by the
measurement of some ancillary quantity, such as the period of variability. Other
examples of standard candles include Type-Ia supernov\ae, that we shall briefly
touch upon in section~\ref{sec:supernovae}. And of course the very concept of standard
candle is a slippery one, and the measurement principle we have outlined is potentially
plagued by subtle systematic effects, but nonetheless it is instrumental in the
intermediate part of the cosmic-distance ladder.



\subsection{Hubble law and cosmological redshift}
\label{sec:hubble_law}

The spectrum of the light emitted by a star typically contain atomic \emph{absorption}
lines caused by the relatively cold gas in the upper atmosphere. Since when we look
at a galaxy we are looking at the sum of individual stars\sidenote{Active galaxies
may contain \emph{emission} lines from much hotter gas in the environment.}, it turns
out that galaxy spectra contain a number of spectral features a well-know frequencies,
determined by the absorbing material, that can be used to measure the relative velocity
along the line of sight via Doppler shift. The measurement of the \emph{redshift}
of any given galaxy
\begin{align}
	z = \frac{\lambda_\text{obs} - \lambda_\text{em}}{\lambda_\text{em}}
\end{align}
is a measure of how fast the galaxy itself is recessing from (or approaching, in
the less common case where $z < 0$) us. More specifically, in the limit where the
recession velocity $v$ is much smaller than the speed of light, we can use the
first order approximation of the Doppler formula
\begin{align*}
	z \approx \beta = \frac{v}{c} \quad\text{or}\quad v = zc.
\end{align*}

By 1927 it was know that the vast majority of the galaxies with measured redshift
was characterized by a value $z > 0$---that means, if we really buy into the Doppler
effect interpretation of the cosmological redshift, that most of the galaxies are
recessing from us. In 1929 Hubble also noted that more distant galaxies tended to
have higher redshifts~\cite{1929PNAS...15..168H}, and fitted the data\sidenote{Measuring
the distance of a cosmological object is a highly non-trivial task and, as a matter
of fact, in the original publication Hubble was severely underestimating the distances
to the individual galaxies, which yielded an unrealistically high value for $H_0$
of $ 500$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$.} with a linear relation
\begin{align}
	z = \frac{H_0}{c}d \quad\text{or}\quad v = H_0 d,
\end{align}
where $H_0$ has made it into cosmological mainstream as the \emph{Hubble constant}.
The most recent precision measurements point to a value for the Hubble constant of
$H_0 \sim 70$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. (Note that, despite the funny units it is
usually expressed with, the Hubble constant has the dimension of the inverse of a
time---more about this in a second.) This is relevant for our discussion, because
measuring redshifts is relatively easy, and one can invert Hubble law and infer
the distance from the redshift
\begin{align*}
  d = \frac{zc}{H_0}.
\end{align*}

\keyfigures{Hubble law}{
  $H_0 \approx 67.66$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$\\
  $\tau_H = H_0^{-1} \approx 14.45$~Gyr\\
  $r_H = cH_0^{-1} \approx 4.431$~Gpc\\
  $\density_c \approx 8.599 \times 10^{-30}$~g~cm$^{-3}$
}

It is interesting to note that the fact that all distant galaxies are recessing
from us (and more so the more distant they are) is not a blatant violation of the
Copernican principle\sidenote{We shall come back to the topic but, in a nutshell,
the Copernican principle states that the Earth, and us humans with it, does not
occupy a priviledge place in the universe.}, but rather it is exactly what one would
expect if the universe was undergoing an homogeneous and isotropic expansion, where
all distances within pairs of objects scale with a factor $a(t)$ increasing with time:
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d_{12}(t)}{a(t)} = \frac{d_{12}(t_0)}{a(t_0)} \quad\text{or}\quad
	d_{12}(t) = \frac{a(t)}{a(t_0)} d_{12}(t_0) = \frac{a(t)}{a_0} d_{12}(t_0).
\end{align*}
If we take the time derivative it is trivial to demonstrate that
\begin{align*}
	v_{12}(t) = \frac{\dot{a}(t)}{a_0} d_{12}(t_0) = \frac{\dot{a}(t)}{a(t)} d_{12}(t),
\end{align*}
and therefore the Hubble parameter\sidenote{Make sure you take note of the subtlety,
here: there is no guarantee that $H$ would stay constant throughout the evolution
of the universe and we call the function $H(t)$ the Hubble parameter, while we reserve
the name Hubble constant for the value $H_0$ of the Hubble parameter at the present
time.} is simply
\begin{align}
	H(t) = \frac{\dot{a(t)}}{a(t)}.
\end{align}

Let us go along with this na\"ive argument and assume that this expansion has been
at work continuously with no acceleration or deceleration. It follows that, no matter
what is the current distance $d_{12}$ between the two points today, they where bound
to be in contact a some point in the past, and the time elapsed since that time is
\begin{align*}
	\tau_H = \frac{d_{12}}{v_{12}} = \frac{d_{12}}{H_0 d_{12}} = H_0^{-1}.
\end{align*}
$H_0^{-1}$ is generally referred to as the \emph{Hubble time}, and for our fiducial
value of $H_0$ its numerical value is of the order of 14~Gyr. This is about a factor
of three larger than the age of the Earth, which is, in many ways, reassuring: if
this has anything to to with the age of the universe, that it better be of the same
order of magnitude of the oldest things that we know of\sidenote{Fun fact: if we
take the initial estimate of $H_0$ by Hubble, we end up with a significantly shorter
Hubble time of 2~Gyr, which was troubling back in the days, as geologists had already
inferred a resonably accurate estimate for the age of the Earth, twice as large.}.

And of course we can't help noting that if you multiply the Hubble time by the speed
of light you get a natural length scale
\begin{align*}
  r_H = \frac{c}{H_0} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{28}~\text{cm}
  \approx 4.3~\text{Gpc} \approx 14~\text{Glyr},
\end{align*}
which is sometimes referred to as the \emph{Hubble radius}. If the Hubble time is a
proxy of the age of the universe, the Hubble radius would be signaling the distance
of the horizon beyond which anything that happened wouldn't have had time to reach us.

There is another interesting quantity that we can calculate---that of the
\emph{critical density} of the universe. Let us consider an arbitrary point, and
a test mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from that point; the latter will be radially
receding with a kinetic energy
\begin{align*}
  E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}mH_0^2 r^2.
\end{align*}
We shall make a step forward and assume that the universe is isotropic and
homogeneous\sidenote{As we shall see in the following, this is the basic content of
the cosmological principle, and one of the basic assumption that goes into modern
cosmology.}, with a constant density $\density$. The potential energy of our test
mass due to the gravitational attraction from the mass $M(r)$ within a sphere of radius
$r$ centered on the initial point will be
\begin{align*}
  U_G = \frac{G m M(r)}{r} = \frac{4\pi Gm \density r^2}{3}.
\end{align*}
If we now equate the two terms and solve for $\density$, we can derive the \emph{critical}
value $\density_c$ of the density for which the velocity of our test mass at infinity
is zero
\begin{align}
  \density_c = \frac{3H_0^2}{8\pi G} \approx 8.599 \times 10^{-30}~\text{g~cm}^{-3}
	\quad\text{and}\quad
	\density_c c^2 \approx 4.824~\text{keV}~\text{cm}^{-3}.
\end{align}
As we shall see in the following, this holds in general relativity, and it is a
fundamental parameter determining the expansion history of the universe.



\section{The Earth}
\label{sec:earth}

\keyfigures{Earth caracteristics}{
  Mean radius: $R_E = 6378$~km\\
  Mean density: $\density_E = 5.52$~g~cm$^{-3}$
}

Now that we have a grasp on some of the scales of length (and how we measure them)
involved in the description of the universe, we are ready to begin our journey, and
we do that starting from the thing that is closest to us, the Earth, outward.

Moving off the surface of the Earth the first two things that we encounter are the
Earth atmosphere and the geomagnetic field. As we shall see, both are relevant to
our discussion for a series of reasons.



\subsection{The Earth atmosphere}
\label{sec:earth_atmosphere}

The Earth atmosphere is the very thing that shields us from most of the celestial
electromagnetic radiation (with the exception of two relatively narrow windows in
optical and radio) and low-energy cosmic rays, and, in addition, it acts as a sort
of gigantic calorimeter allowing us to detect very-high-energy gamma rays and charged
cosmic rays---generating as a by-product copious amounts of neutrinos that, as we
shall see, proved to be instrumental in the determination of the properties of this
elusive particle.

The most salient features of the atmosphere can be understood in terms of the equation
for the hydrostatic equilibrium:
\begin{align*}
  \pressure(h + dh) - \pressure(h) = -g\density(h) \diff{h}
  \quad\text{or}\quad
  \dv{\pressure}{h}{(h)} = -g\density(h)
\end{align*}
If we assume that the atmosphere follows the ideal gas law
\begin{align*}
  \pressure = \frac{\density RT}{\mu}
  \quad\text{or}\quad
  \density = \frac{\pressure \mu}{RT}
\end{align*}
we can rewrite the equilibrium equation as
\begin{align}\label{eq:atmosphere_hydrostatic_equilibrium}
  \dv{\pressure}{h}{(h)} = - \frac{g\mu \pressure(h)}{RT(h)}
\end{align}
where $\mu$ is average molar mass of the gas, which we shall take as
$\mu \sim 29$~g~mol$^{-1}$, assuming a composition of 80\% of $N_2$ and 20\% of $O_2$.

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/atmospheric_density.pgf}
  \caption{Barometric density profile for an isothermal atmosphere at $T = 240^\circ$~K.}
  \label{fig:atmospheric_density}
\end{marginfigure}

Equation~\eqref{eq:atmosphere_hydrostatic_equilibrium} can only be numerically integrated
for a generic temperature profile, but simplifies considerably if the temperature
is constant, which is generally referred to as the isothermal atmosphere limit,
where the solutions for both the pressure and the density are simple exponential
functions
\begin{align}
  \pressure(h) = \pressure_0 \exp\left(-\frac{h}{h_0}\right)\quad
  \density(h) = \density_0 \exp\left(-\frac{h}{h_0}\right)\quad
  h_0 = \frac{RT}{g\mu}.
\end{align}
If we assume a temperature $T \sim 240^\circ$~K, the scale height for our simplified
atmosphere turns out to be $h_0 \sim 7$~km, which provides a surprisingly accurate
model at least up to the mesopause, at an altitude of about 90~km. In the following
we shall also assume the standard values for the pressure and density at sea level
\begin{align}
  \pressure_0 = 1013~\text{mbar}
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  \density_0 = 1.24~\text{mg~cm}^{-3}.
\end{align}

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/atmospheric_grammage.pgf}
  \caption{Grammage profile for an isothermal atmosphere at $T = 240^\circ$~K.}
  \label{fig:atmospheric_grammage}
\end{marginfigure}

These very ingredients allow to calculate a number of interesting quantities.
The grammage \emph{above} a given altitude $h$, e.g., follows the same exponential
law
\begin{align}\label{eq:atmospheric_grammage}
  \grammage(h) = \int_h^\infty \density(h') \diff{h'} =
  \density_0 h_0 \exp\left(-\frac{h}{h_0}\right).
\end{align}
It is interesting to note that the atmospheric grammage at sea level is
$\density_0 h_0 \sim 900~\text{g~cm}^{-2}$, equivalent to a column height of
$\sim 80$~cm if rescaled to the density of lead---which is the basic reason why
primary cosmic rays above $\sim 10$~eV do not reach the Earth surface.



\subsection{The Earth magnetic field}
\label{sec:geomagnetic_field}

Everybody is familiar with the fact that the Earth generates a magnetic field, and
the magnitude of this field is $\sim 0.5$~G. As it turns out, enormous progress
has been made, over the last century or so, in mapping the basic properties of the
geomagnetic field---modern \emph{professional} descriptions, such as the International
Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) contain expansions up to order 13~\cite{2010GeoJI.183.1216F}.
In this section we shall limit ourselves to a cursory description of the most basic
features.

In the following of this section we shall use spherical coordinates
$(r, \theta, \phi)$\sidenote{In addition to the magnetic co-latitude $\theta$, we
shall also occasionally make use of the magnetic latitude $\lambda = 90^\circ - \theta$,
which is widely used in the literature.} centered and aligned with the magnetic
dipole generating the lowest-order component of the geomagnetic field.
In source-free regions (i.e., above the Earth's surface), since
$\nabla \times {\mathbf B} = 0$, the static magnetic field can be expressed as
the negative gradient of a scalar potential $\psi$, just like the ordinary
electrostatic field. This potential, in turn, can be expanded in spherical
harmonics as
\begin{align}\label{eq:geomag_expansion}
  \psi(r, \theta, \phi) =&
  R_E \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{R_E}{r}\right)^{n+1}\nonumber\\
  &\sum_{m=0}^{n}(g_n^m\cos m\phi + h_n^m\sin m\phi)P_n^m(\cos\theta).
\end{align}
(The reader is referred to \cite{Walt} for the exact definition of the
terms; we limit ourselves to note that, with the expansion written in this
form, $g_n^m$ and $h_n^m$ have the dimensions of a magnetic field.)

\keyfigures{Geomagnetic field}{
  $B_0 \approx 0.312$~G
}

Many of the features of the geomagnetic field can be effectively illustrated
by truncating the expansion to the lowest-order (i.e., the dipole) term, with
$n = 1$ and $m = 0$ (which is the same as saying that the Earth's magnetic
field is, to a reasonable approximation, a dipole field):
\begin{align}
  \psi(r, \theta, \phi) = R_E \left(\frac{R_E}{r}\right)^{2} B_0 \cos\theta.
\end{align}
(We have set $g_1^0 = B_0$ for convenience---more about that in a second.)
Noting that $B_\phi$ is identically $0$ for symmetry reasons, the two non-trivial
components of the magnetic field\sidenote{Keep in mind that
the gradient in spherical coordinates reads
$$
\nabla = \left( \pdv{}{r},~\frac{1}{r}\pdv{}{\theta},~\frac{1}{r\sin\theta}\pdv{}{\phi}\right).
$$
} read
\begin{align}\label{eq:dipole_field_components}
  \begin{cases}
  B_r(r, \theta, \phi) & = \displaystyle -\pdv{\psi}{r} =
  2 B_0  \left(\frac{R_E}{r}\right)^3 \cos\theta,\\
  B_\theta(r, \theta, \phi) & = \displaystyle -\frac{1}{r}\pdv{\psi}{\theta} =
  B_0 \left(\frac{R_E}{r}\right)^3 \sin\theta.
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
That is, the field is purely radial at the poles and purely tangential at the equator.
For completeness, the intensity of the dipole field at any given point is given by
\begin{align*}
  B(r, \theta, \phi) =
  \sqrt{B_r^2(r, \theta, \phi) + B_\theta^2(r, \theta, \phi)}
  = B_0 \left(\frac{R_E}{r}\right)^3 \sqrt{1 + 3\cos^2\theta}.
\end{align*}
From the above expressions it is easy to recognize that physically $B_0$ represents
the field intensity at the equator ($\theta = 90^\circ$) on the Earth surface
($r = R_E$). It is also easy to recognize that the field intensity on the Earth
surface is minimum at the equator and twice as large at the magnetic poles.

Even more important, it follows from~\eqref{eq:dipole_field_components} that
the equation for a geomagnetic field line, is
\begin{align}
  \frac{dr}{rd\theta} = \frac{B_r}{B_\theta} = \frac{2\cos\theta}{\sin\theta},
\end{align}
which is readily integrated\sidenote{Mind when you do that you have logarithms on
both sides that simplify.} to give:
\begin{align}
  r = R_EL\sin^2\theta.
\end{align}
At this point the quantity $L$ in the equation above (which is customarily referred
to as the McIlwain~$L$ coordinate) is just a constant of integration, but one with
a pretty straightforward physical interpretation---it is the distance, measured
in units of Earth radii, at which a given field line crosses the magnetic equator
($\theta = 90^\circ$). For completeness, the McIlwain~$L$ coordinate can be expressed
in term of the geomagnetic coordinates as
\begin{align}
  L = \frac{r}{R_E \sin^2\theta} = \frac{r}{R_E \cos^2\lambda},
\end{align}
which becomes
\begin{align}
  L = \frac{1}{\sin^2\theta} = \frac{1}{\cos^2\lambda}
\end{align}
on the surface of the Earth ($r = R_E$). The McIlwain~$L$ coordinate is convenient
to describe the population of trapped particles in the Earth magnetosphere, although
there are some subtleties involved in its definition for non-dipolar field geometries.

The actual geomagnetic field is not a perfectly aligned and centered dipole.
First of all the dipole axis is misaligned by $\sim 11^\circ$ with respect to
the spin axis of the Earth. In addition, the center of the dipole does not
coincide with the center of the Earth (the offset being of the order of 700~km).
Finally, asymmetries in the interior current system generating the magnetic
field produce higher-order terms in the expansion~\eqref{eq:geomag_expansion}.
Not surprisingly, all of this is beyond the scope of this writeup, and it is now
time to move on.



\section{The Sun}
\label{sec:sun}

We shall say up front we're not really interested into planets, and the very next
thing we encounter moving away from the Earth and within the Solar system is the
star that is closest to us---the Sun. The Sun is relevant to us because it makes
the portion of the galaxy we happen to live in (the \emph{heliosphere}) a very special
place---the spectrum of low-energy cosmic rays, for instance, is highly influenced
by the solar environment. In addition, as we shall see in chapter~\ref{chap:nu},
the Sun was recognized very early on as a powerful source of neutrinos, and this
realization played a pivotal role in the determination of some of the fundamental
neutrino properties.

\keyfigures{Sun caracteristics}{
	Mass: $M_\odot = 1.99 \times 10^{30}$~kg\\
	Radius: $R_\odot = 6.96 \times 10^8$~m\\
	Luminosity: $L_\odot = 3.83 \times 10^{26}$~W\\
}

A few quick facts: the Sun is, by all standards, a typical star---a G-type main
sequence star, as we shall see in the next section. With a mass of $\sim 2 \times 10^{30}$~kg and
a radius of $\sim 700,000$~km, it shines with a spectrum that is well described by
a blackbody with a temperature of $\sim 5700^\circ$K, with a total irradiance at
the top of the atmosphere of $F_\odot \approx 1361$~W~m$^{-2}$, or
$1.361 \times 10^6$~erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$.


\subsection{The Solar inner structure}

Stars are self-gravitating bodies in dynamical equilibrium, where the attractive
gravitational force is counter-balanced by the internal pressure, be it that of
the gas and/or of the radiation. Since stars continuously loose energy, most notably
by radiation from the surface, an internal energy source is needed to avoid collapse,
and for regular stars this source is provided by the nuclear reactions taking place
in the inner part of the star itself. In the case of the Sun the main mechanism
generating energy is the fusion of $H$ into $He$.

\keyfigures{Sun core}{
	Density: $\density_c = 150.5$~g~cm$^{-3}$\\
	Pressure: $\pressure_c = 3.45 \times 10^{11}$~atm\\
	Temperature: $T_c = 1.55 \times 10^7~^\circ$K\\
}

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\input{figures/sun_standard_model.pgf}
	\caption{Basic Sun characteristics according to the BS05 Sun standard model
  described in~\cite{2005ApJ...621L..85B}. According to the model, the temperature

  The temperature and density approximately follow an exponential law across mos
  of the radial profile.}
    \label{fig:sun_standard_model}
\end{figure}

The general problem of stellar structure is a very complex one (and one that can
only be solved by means of numerical methods) where several different inter-dependent
factors come into play: the hydrostatic equilibrium, the mass and energy conservation,
and the energy transport. From a technical standpoint, even under the simplifying
assumption of spherical symmetry, the complete description of the star interior
requires the solution of seven coupled differential equations for seven unknown
function of the radial coordinate $r$. Since this is not a suspense novel, we
shall say up front that these calculations are standard, nowadays, and
figure~\ref{fig:sun_standard_model} provides a succinct summary of what the
\emph{standard solar model} looks like.

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/gravitational_energy.pgf}
  \caption{Basic sketch for setting up the hydrostatic equilibrium in a star.}
\end{marginfigure}

We shall limit ourselves to some back-of-the-envelope calculations to gauge the orders
of magnitude, here. If we consider a generic spherical shell of radius $r$ and
(infinitesimal) thickness $dr$ inside the Sun, we should require that gravitational
attraction per unit surface by the mass $M(r)$ of the sphere enclosed in the shell
is counter-balancing the gradient of the pressure, i.e.,
\begin{align}\label{eq:hydro_equilibrium}
  \frac{G M(r)\density(r) dr}{r^2} = \pressure(r) - \pressure(r + dr)
  \quad\text{or}\quad
  \dv{\pressure}{r}{(r)} = -\frac{G M(r) \density(r)}{r^2}.
\end{align}
(If this sounds familiar it is because it is exactly what we have done, in a planar
geometry, for the Earth atmosphere.)

Now, if we had a detailed model describing how the density $\density(r)$,
and therefore the mass $M(r)$, vary with the radius, we could readily solve this
equation to calculate the pressure---but that is too complicated. We can get a
crude estimate of the quantities we are interested in by dividing both sides
by $4\pi r^2 \density(r)$, after which the equilibrium equation reads
\begin{align}
  \dv{\pressure}{M}{(M)} = -\frac{G M}{4\pi r^4}.
\end{align}
This is really not any simpler than before---all we really have done is to change
our dynamical variable from $r$ to $M(r)$, so that $P$ is now a function of
$M$, and this would work great if $M$ was all that is left on the right-hand side,
but unfortunately the $r^4$ at the denominator prevents us from writing a solution
in closed form. But we can do some brutal assumption to try and make some progress.
On the left hand of the equation we are looking for a pressure that decreases from a
maximum value $\pressure_c$ at the center of the Sun (where the mass enclosed in
the corresponding shell is $M = 0$) to zero on the surface, where $M = M_\odot$, and
for the sake of the argument we can just pretend that the scaling is linear and the
(constant) slope is
\begin{align*}
	\frac{d\pressure}{dM} = -\frac{\pressure_c}{M_\odot} \quad
	\text{(fictional assumption)}
\end{align*}

\begin{marginfigure}
	\input{figures/sun_pm_fictional.pgf}
	\caption{Toy model for the Sun pressure profile as a function of the mass variable
	$M$.}
\end{marginfigure}

At this point the right-hand part of the equation must be assumed to be constant,
and there is no way to do that in a self-consistent fashion, as there is no guarantee
that the $M(r)$ scales as $r^4$ (although, if we admit that the density decreases
with $r$ we are forced to admit that it scales with a power of $r$ greater than 3,
so our setup might not be completely unreasonable, actually). All we can do is to pick
a particular value of $r$ and make an educated guess on the enclosed mass $M(r)$.
If we say, for instance, that half of the solar mass is enclosed in a circle of radius
$\nicefrac{1}{4} R_\odot$, we end up with\sidenote{The reader is not mistaken if they
are under the impression that there is some level of sorcery involved in this argument.
Beside the assumption that the pressure scales linearly with the mass, we could have
literally taken any pair of $r$ and $m$ values to fix the right-hand side. Had we
picked $M_\odot$ and $R_\odot$ (all the mass in included within the solar radius),
we would have come with an estimate 40~times smaller. (See, however,
figure~\ref{fig:sun_standard_model} for a hit to where our guess is coming from.)
It is fair to say that our figure is just a little more than a dimensional argument,
providing the correct scaling with the quantities involved, but in order to get a
more accurate numerical factor, a significantly more complex modeling would be required.}
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\pressure_c}{M_\odot} = \frac{32}{\pi} \frac{G M_\odot}{R_\odot^4}
	  \quad\text{or}\quad
    \pressure_c = \frac{32}{\pi} \frac{G M_\odot^2}{R_\odot^4}
		\approx 1.1 \times 10^{11}~\text{atm}.
\end{align*}
This is merely a factor of three wrong on the low side, as the pressure at the
center of the Sun yielded by the state-of-the-art modeling is actually
$3.45 \times 10^{11}$~atm---not bad for such a back-of-the-envelope calculation.

If we now want to calculate the temperature $T_c$ at the center of the Sun, all we
need is an equation of state. For the sake of simplicity we shall assume that the
matter in the Sun is made of fully ionized atoms (that is, free atomic nuclei and
fellow electrons), obeying the ideal gas law---more on this later, but we anticipate
that this is not a bad assumption at all. The ideal gas law reads
\begin{align}
  \pressure = \sum_i (1 + Z_i)n_i \kT = \sum_i (1 + Z_i) \frac{\density_i \kT}{m_p A_i}
\end{align}
where $n_i$, $\density_i$, $Z_i$ and $A_i$ are the number density, mass density,
atomic number and the mass number of the $i$-th ion species, and the sum is extended
to all the species. The factor $(1 + Z_i)$ is due to the fact that for every nucleus
of atomic number $Z_i$ we have $Z_i$ electrons (in addition to the nucleus itelf)
contributing to the pressure. If we pretend for a second that the Sun is entirely
composed of ionized $H$ ($Z = 1$, $A = 1$), this reduces to\sidenote{Mind the factor
of 2: one for the proton, and one for the electron}
\begin{align*}
	\pressure = \frac{2\density \kT}{m_p} \quad\text{or}\quad
  T = \frac{P m_p}{2\density \kB}
\end{align*}
and we can gauge the temperature at the center of the Sun with
\begin{align*}
  T_c = \frac{\pressure_c m_p}{2 \density_c \kB} =
	\frac{16}{\pi} \frac{G M_\odot^2 m_p}{R_\odot^4 \density_c \kB}.
\end{align*}
The only slight problem is that we don't know the value $\density_c$ of the density
at the center of the Sun, but is we stick with our na\"ive prescription for the density
profile (half the mass within $\nicefrac{1}{4}$ of the radius) we get a generous
lower limit
\begin{align*}
	\density_c \geq \frac{24}{\pi} \frac{M_\odot}{R_\odot^3} \approx 45~\text{g~cm}^{-3},
\end{align*}
which, amusingly, is again about a factor of three too low---the actual density at
the center of the Sun is about $150$~g~cm$^{-3}$, or 7.5~times that of the tungsten.
The two factors of three do cancel out when we take the ratio, which produced the
accurate estimate for the temperature $T_c$
\begin{align*}
	T_c = \frac{2}{3} \frac{m_p G M_\odot}{\kB R_\odot} \approx 1.5 \times 10^7~^\circ\text{K}
\end{align*}
which is in line with the canonical value from a detailed stellar modeling.
Keep note of the relative scaling of the thermodynamic quantities at the center
of a star
\begin{align}
	P_c \propto \frac{M_s^2}{R_s^4} \text{,}\quad
	\density_c \propto \frac{M_s}{R_s^3} \quad\text{and}\quad
	T_c \propto \frac{M_s}{R_s}
\end{align}
because they will be useful in the following\sidenote{The latter in particular (i.e.,
the fact that the core temperature of a star is inversely proportional to its radius)
is very important in the internal dynamic of the star, as we shall see in more
detail in section~\ref{sec:stars_virial_theorem}.}.

Now that we have an estimate of the temperature at the center of the Sun we can
re-examine out assumption that the equation of state of the solar interior is that
of a perfect gas. The pressure for a photon gas is
\begin{align*}
	\pressure_\text{rad} = \frac{4\sigma}{3c} T_c^4 \approx 1.4 \times 10^{8}~\text{atm}
\end{align*}
which in our case is only about 0.1\% of that from the ideal gas law we have
used---radiation pressure is just subdominant in a star with the mass of the
Sun\sidenote{Note, however, that while the ideal gas pressure is proportional to
the temperature, radiation pressure scales as $T^4$, and the ratio between the
two goes like $T^3$: if the temperature in the core of teh Sun was just a mere
order of magnitude larger, the radiation pressure would be dominant.}.

In section~\ref{sec:white_dwarfs} we shall see that for \emph{degenerate} stars
there exists yet another source of pressure that, in some cases, determines the
stellar equilibrium.



\section{Stars}
\label{sec:stars}

In ancient times, our knowledge of the universe was limited to the Earth, the
Moon, the Sun, the closest planets in the solar system and the few thousands
stars that are visible at night to the naked eye. While it is extremely difficult
to summarize in the form of simple metrics the enormous progress done since the
telescope revolutionized astronomy at the beginning of the seventeenth century,
the historical development of astronomical catalogues, shown in
figure~\ref{fig:astronomical_catalogues}, provides an interesting cross section
of how our understanding has expanded over the last four centuries.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\input{figures/astronomical_catalogues.pgf}
  \caption{Compilation of the number of objects as a function of publication year
    for a few, historically relevant astronomical catalogs. The choice of the
    particular catalogs is largely arbitrary, and driven mainly by the intent
    of showing the evolution of the overall number of distinct astronomical objects
    catalogues at any given time.}
    \label{fig:astronomical_catalogues}
\end{figure}

Compared with the 1050 sources in the classical catalogue by Ptolemy, that has been
the ultimate reference for astronomers for some 1500~years since its completion in
AD 150, the third data release of the Gaia  mission~\cite{2023A&A...674A...1G}
includes almost 2~\emph{billion} distinct sources. This figure will be more than an
order of magnitude larger when the final catalog of the Large Synaptic Survey
Telescope (LSST) is released, some time in the 2030's. In the meantime, astronomy
opened itself to all the other wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, and
we know today about 1.5~million X-ray sources, spread across a multitude of different
catalogs, and more than 5000 $\gamma$-ray sources~\cite{2020ApJS..247...33A}, along
with millions of sources in the radio, infrared, and ultraviolet bands. In addition,
the universe is studied by means of completely different cosmic messengers: background
radiation at all the electromagnetic wavelengths (most notably the CMB), charged
cosmic rays, neutrino and gravitational waves---all of which have full citizenship
in astro-particle physics.



\subsection{Flux, luminosity, and magnitude}
\label{sec:stars_magnitude}

Although, in ancient times, the main object of astronomy was the study of the position
of celestial objects and their motion in the sky, early astronomers were very well
aware that different stars had different brightness. In Ptolemy's catalog, dated
ca.~AD~150, the stars are divided in 6 classes of brightness (1 to 6 from the
brightest to the dimmest) according to their \emph{apparent magnitude}---and
most likely this classification predates Ptolemy by at least a few centuries.

In modern language the apparent brightness of a celestial object is measured in
terms of its radiant flux $F$, which is the total energy received per unit time
and area, and is customarily expressed in erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$. The flux, in turn,
depends on both the intrinsic luminosity $L$ of the object (that is, the total energy
radiated per unit time, expressed in erg~s$^{-1}$) and its distance $d$ according
to the inverse square law
\begin{align}
  F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}.
\end{align}
The total solar irradiance at the top of the atmosphere, as we said, is
$F_\odot \approx 1361$~W~m$^{-2}$, or $1.361 \times 10^6$~erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$,
which, according to the inverse square law, corresponds to a luminosity
$L_\odot \approx 3.828 \times 10^{26}$~W or $3.828 \times 10^{33}$~erg~s$^{-1}$.

The modern definition of apparent magnitude%
\sidenote{While the magnitude scale was first formalized by Norman~R. Pogson in
  1856~\cite{1856MNRAS..17...12P}, the definition of the zero point $F_0$ has
  changed several times over the years, and the reader should not be surprised
  by the slight inconsistencies that can be found in the literature.}
is largely designed to keep backward compatibility with the historical catalogs:
the magnitude scale is an inverse logarithmic scale where 5 magnitudes correspond
exactly to a factor of 100\sidenote{Not surprisingly, this is the approximate dynamic
range of the naked human eye when looking at the night sky.}---that is, one magnitude
unit corresponds to a factor $\sqrt[5]{100} \approx 2.512$:
\begin{align}
  m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F}{F_0} \right).
\end{align}

\begin{margintable}
  \begin{tabular}{lrr}
    \hline
    Filter & $\lambda_0$ & $\Delta\lambda$ (FWHM)\\
    \hline
    \hline
    V & 551~nm & 88~nm\\
    B & 445~nm & 94~nm\\
    U & 365~nm & 66~nm\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Representative values for the midpoint wavelength and bandwidth for
    commonly used filters.}
  \label{tab:vbu_filters}
\end{margintable}

This definition can be applied within any given band of the electromagnetic
spectrum and, as we shall see in a moment, it is customary to observe celestial
objects through different filters---e.g., visible ($V$), blue ($B$) and
ultraviolet ($U$), as illustrated in table~\ref{tab:vbu_filters}, with associated
apparent magnitudes $m_\text{V}$, $m_\text{B}$ and $m_\text{U}$.
An additional important concept is the \emph{apparent bolometric magnitude}
$m_\text{bol}$, which refers to the flux integrated over all the wavelengths, and
is directly tied to the total energy output of a given source. We note that the
arbitrary reference flux (or zero point) $F_0$ is set independently within each
energy band. The recommended reference bolometric flux, for instance, is
$F_0 = 2.518 \times 10^{-8}$~W~m$^{-2}$ or $2.518 \times 10^{-5}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$,
and with this convention, the apparent bolometric magnitude of the Sun is
$-26.832$\sidenote{It is amusing to note that, while the approximate dynamic range of the human naked
eye is a mere 2 orders of magnitude, modern space telescopes can observe objects
as dim as a stunning $35$~apparent magnitude---that is, with a radiance some
25~orders of magnitude lower than that of the Sun!}.

When the distance to a celestial object is know, the inverse square laws allows
to define an \emph{absolute magnitude} $M$, which is set conventionally to the
apparent magnitude $m$ that the object would have if it was placed at a distance
of $d_0 = 10$~pc%
%\sidenote{The problem is in fact significantly more complicated due to the
%  stellar extinction affecting distant sources, but this is sufficient for our
%  purposes.}
\begin{align}
  M = m - 5 \log \left( \frac{d}{d_0} \right) \quad\text{or}\quad
  (m - M) = 5 \log \left( \frac{d}{d_0} \right).
\end{align}
The absolute magnitude is a fundamental quantity because it is related to the
intrinsic luminosity of the object. (The Sun, e.g., has a modest absolute
bolometric magnitude of $4.74$). The quantity $m - M$ if function solely of the
distance and is customarily called the \emph{distance modulus}.



\subsection{Temperature and color}
\label{sec:stars_color}

Stars differs not only in intrinsic luminosity, but also in \emph{color}. This is
visible to the naked eye in favorable observing conditions, and it is something
that is occasionally commented upon in the historical accounts of astronomical
observations. The quantum theory of light\sidenote{If you did not have a chance
to review appendix~\ref{chap:qstat}, this is definitely a good time to take a look!}
allows to recast this qualitative observation in quantitative terms, and modern
instruments provides precise spectroscopic measurements to test the theory against
experimental data.

When we observe the light emitted by a star, what we are mainly looking at is its
(relatively cold) atmosphere. If we assume that this photosphere is a
blackbody\sidenote{Sure enough, no star is a perfect blackbody, and yet this is a
surprisingly good approximation, and one that allows to derive a number of interesting
and far-reaching consequences that allow to gain profund insight into the inner
workings of these objects.}, we know that the spectrum of the radiation is described
by the Planck distribution, and depends on a single parameter---the effective temperature.
The hotter the blackbody, the shorter the wavelength (or the higher the frequency
and energy) at which the spectrum peaks, as captured by Wien's displacement law
(see section~\ref{sec:wien_law}).

The interesting thing is that, due to the shape of the Planck distribution, the
measurement of the flux at two distinct wavelengths (or within two distinct narrow
bands) provides enough information to recover the characteristic temperature of
the parent spectral distribution, as illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:color_index}.
This is at the base of an experimental technique routinely used in practice---that is:
observing the same object with two filters, e.g., blue (B) and visible (V), and
then combining the measured flux values in a so called \emph{color index}
\begin{align}
  (B - V) = m_B - m_V = -2.5 \log_{10}\left( \frac{F_B}{F_V} \right).
\end{align}
The $(B - V)$ color index of the Sun is $0.656$; blue-ish objects have a smaller
color index, and red-ish objects have a larger color index.
Owing to its differential nature, the measurement of the color index has the good
property that, at least in principle, it does not depend on the source brightness,
and some of the possible sources of systematic effects do cancel out in the process.

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/planck_color_index.pgf}
  \caption{Sketch of the measurement principle for the color index. The curves in
    the two panels are the Planck distribution, in wavelength space, at two
    different temperatures. Measuring the radiance at two different
    wavelengths---or, more realistic, using two filters with a finite band-pass
    centered at these wavelengths---allows to recover the temperature.}
  \label{fig:color_index}
\end{marginfigure}

In practice, things are significantly more complicated due to a number of subtle
effects, including the fact that the stellar extinction is frequency-dependent,
producing a distinct \emph{reddening}. More importantly, real stars are not
perfect blackbodies, and measuring the effective temperature of the photosphere
involves a level of modeling that is significantly more complex that just
integrating the Planck distribution. As a result, a number of empirical compilations
is available that can be used to convert a given temperature in the corresponding
color index and vice versa~\cite{1996ApJ...469..355F, 1998JRASC..92...36R, 2012EL.....9734008B}.
Figure~\ref{fig:color_index} shows one of those compilations.

\begin{marginfigure}

    index, compiled from~\cite{1996ApJ...469..355F} and~\cite{1998JRASC..92...36R}.}

\end{marginfigure}



\subsection{The HR diagram}
\label{sec:stars_hr}

\begin{figure*}[!tbp]
  \input{figures/herzprung_russel_diagram.pgf}
  \caption{Illustrative Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, with the observational quantities
    (color index and magnitude) running on the bottom and left axes, and the
    corresponding theoretical quantities (temperature and luminosity) running on
    the top and right ones; the diagonal grids are the iso-radius curves in the
    color index-magnitude space implied by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, according to
    the prescription in~\cite{1998JRASC..92...36R}. Stellar data
    are taken from the Hipparcos-Yale-Gliese (HYG) database available
    at~\href{https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database}{here}, and we emphasize
    that the source selection performed here is eccentric by any sensible metrics:
    it is intended for the reader to have a sense of the main sub-populations
    (main sequence, white dwarfs, red giants), but it is in no way meant, e.g.,
    to provide an unbiased sense as to what the relative proportions are.
    The data for the index-magnitude evolution of the small sample of supernov\ae\
    at the top---which for good reasons is almost never shown on the HR diagram---are
    taken from~\cite{2018MNRAS.473..513F} and provide an amusing illustration
    of how core-collapse SNe fit in the context of normal stellar systems
    (the small superscript "n~d" labels provides the time since the explosion,
    in days, at the start and the end of the monitoring observations).}
  \label{fig:hr}
\end{figure*}

We now have all the ingredients to introduce the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram.
From an observational prospective, the HR diagram is a simple scatter plot with
the color index running over the $x$-axis, and the absolute visual magnitude running
over the $y$-axis, such as the one shown in~figure~\ref{fig:hr}.
Since the color index is a proxy for the temperature of the star photosphere
and the absolute magnitude is proportional to its intrinsic luminosity, the HR
diagram can also be seen as a temperature-luminosity scatter plot, and the two
types of representations are sometimes referred to as \emph{observational} and
\emph{theoretical} HR diagrams.

A cursory look at the resources available on the web will show that, within the
copious amount of combined HR diagrams available, no one is identical to the
other---this is no coincidence, as there is a number of subtleties involved into
the transition between the observational form of the diagram (which displays
measured quantities, and should be therefore considered as the primary version)
and the theoretical one. First of all the conversion between color index and
temperature, beyond being highly non linear, comes with significant uncertainties
owing to its purely empirical nature---different compilations will provide different
calibration curves, especially at the extremes of the temperature range.
In addition, while the observational HR diagram has the absolute \emph{visual}
magnitude running on the $y$-axis, the theoretical HR diagram is best re-casted
in \emph{bolometric} luminosity, as that is the most sensible measure of the overall
energy output, irrespectively of the star temperature.

Now, it is obvious from figure~\ref{fig:color_index} that the fraction of the spectral
radiance measured in the visual band depends on the temperature: it is largest when
the blackbody spectrum peaks of at the center of the $V$ band (that is, for an effective
temperature of $6000$--$7000~^\circ$K) and smaller (and, quite possibly, much smaller)
for lower and higher temperature. Just like the conversion between temperature
and color index, the bolometric correction can be calculated from first principles
only for a perfect blackbody. For real stars, empirical compilations are available,
such as the one shown in figure~\ref{fig:bolometric_correction}, and can be used
to transform a visual magnitude into a bolometric luminosity for any give effective
temperature.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \input{figures/bolometric_correction.pgf}
    \caption{Empirical parametrization of the bolometric correction, adapted
      from~\cite{1998JRASC..92...36R}. Note that for very hot and very cold
      stars the bolometric correction can exceed $5$~magnitudes---that is, a factor
      of $100$---assuming that the (arbitrary) zero point is set in such a way
      that the correction is $\sim 0$ at the peak.}
    \label{fig:bolometric_correction}
\end{marginfigure}

There is one last piece of information that we have not thrown in the mix, yet:
the Stefan-Boltzmann law (see section~\ref{sec:stefan_boltzmann_law}). If we maintain
that a star is a blackbody, then we know that its luminosity is proportional to the
emitting surface and the fourth power of the temperature:
\begin{align}
  L = A \sigma T^4 = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4.
\end{align}
This means that on a theoretical HR~diagram the lines at constant stellar radii
are power laws with index $4$ (or, in fact, $-4$, since the temperature axis
usually runs in the reverse direction). In an observational HR diagram things
are more complicated, as the relation between the color index and the temperature
is more nuanced for all the reasons explained above (the temperature scale is not
logarithmic and the loci at constant luminosity are not horizontal lines) but it
is not difficult to numerically calculate proper iso-radius contours (under the
assumption that the Stefan-Boltzmann law holds) as shown in figure~\ref{fig:hr}.

Sadly enough, we shall rarely go back to the HR diagram in the following.
In many respects we might say that, as particle astrophysicists, we are chiefly
concerned with the objects at the very top of our illustrative HR diagram
(representing some of the most violent phenomena in the Universe), and those
at the bottom-left corner (which is where matter at the most extreme densities
lives).



\subsection{Stellar equilibrium: the virial theorem}
\label{sec:stars_virial_theorem}

We have seen the equation for the hydrostatic equilibrium~\eqref{eq:hydro_equilibrium}
in our cursory description of the inner structure of the Sun. If we multiply by
$4\pi r^3$ both sides and integrate over the radial coordinate from the center to
the surface of the star we get
\begin{align*}
  \int_0^{R_s} 4\pi r^3 \dv{P}{r}{(r)} dr =
  -\int_0^{R_s} \frac{GM(r)}{r} \, \underbrace{4\pi r^2 \density(r) dr}_{dM}.
\end{align*}
In the right-hand side we immediately recognize the total gravitational potential
energy $U_G$. The left-hand side can be integrated by parts, yielding
\begin{align*}
  \int_0^{R_s} 4\pi r^3 \dv{P}{r} dr =
  \cancel{\left[ 4\pi r^3 P \right]_0^{R_s}} - 3 \int_0^{R_s} P(r) 4\pi r^2 dr
\end{align*}
where the first term in the integral vanishes in virtue of the fact that the pressure
is (approximately) zero at the star surface. For a perfect gas
\begin{align*}
  PV = \mu RT = \mu (C_p - C_v)T =
  \mu C_v T \left( \frac{C_p}{C_v} - 1 \right) = U (\gamma - 1)
\end{align*}
and if we divide both ends by the volume $V$ we get $P = u (\gamma - 1)$, or
\begin{align*}
  \int_0^{R_s} P(r) 4\pi r^2 dr = (\gamma - 1) \int_0^{R_s} u(r) 4\pi r^2 dr =
  (\gamma - 1) U.
\end{align*}
Combining everything together we can express the \emph{virial theorem} for our system
as
\begin{align}
  U_G + 3 (\gamma - 1) U = 0.
\end{align}

It is hard to over-emphasize the importance of this result. The condition for the
total energy to be negative (i.e., for the system to be dynamically stable) reads
\begin{align*}
  E_\text{tot} = U_G + U = (4 - 3\gamma) U < 0 \quad\text{if and only if}\quad \gamma > \frac{4}{3}.
\end{align*}
In the simple case of a mono-atomic ideal gas, when $\gamma = \nicefrac{5}{3}$,
we have
\begin{align}
  U_G = - 2U \quad\text{and}\quad E_\text{tot} = - U = -\frac{3}{2} N \ave{\kB T},
\end{align}
which means that when the system looses energy, the temperature increase---in a
thermodynamical sense this corresponds to a \emph{negative heat capacity}.

Counter-intuitive as this might seem at a first glance, this simply means that
when the stars contracts, half of the gravitational energy is lost from the surface
of the star, and the other half is converted into internal energy (i.e., heat),
causing a raise of the temperature\sidenote{There is an amusing, purely mechanical
analogous of this phenomenon: the decay of the orbit of a satellite, where the
velocity (and the kiketic energy) of the latter increases as the height of the
orbit (and hence the potential energy) decreases.}.
The virial theorem is instrumental in guaranteeing the stability of a star as the
nuclear fuel is burned into its core: if the energy production increase, this
causes the core to expand, which in turn cause the temperature to decrease, which
inhibits additional energy production, providing a negative feedback to the system
and making in stable. (Incidentally, we not that this is true for \emph{normal} stars.
As we shall see in the next sections, for degenerate stars, where the pressure is
independent of the temperature, the situation is very different and the presence
of a positive feedback in that case can lead to a thermonuclear runaway.)

The virial theorem is also of the driving forces of stellar evolution. In the initial
stages of its life, where the nuclear fusion has not started, yet, the
star is bound to loose energy, and since $E_T = \nicefrac{1}{2}U_G$, the gravitational
energy must decrease, which means that the star contracts and its temperature increases.
This will continue until the core is hot enough for the nuclear fusion to be ignited.
The lifecycle of a star is governed by an alternation of contractions and nuclear
burning phases.



\subsection{Compact stars: white dwarfs}
\label{sec:white_dwarfs}

After the 40~Eridani~B and Sirius~B---later to become the first classical
\emph{white dwarfs}--- were discovered, the question of how such sub-luminous objects
could survive the collapse from their own gravitational pressure, in striking
contrast with the accepted paradigm of stellar evolution%
\sidenote{\emph{We learn about the stars by receiving and interpreting the messages
which their light brings to us. The message of the companion of Sirius when it
was decoded ran: 'I am composed of material 3,000 times denser than anything you
have ever come across; a ton of my material would be a little nugget that you
could put in a matchbox.' What reply can one make to such a message? The reply
which most of us made in 1914 was---'Shut up. Don't talk nonsense.'}\\[10pt]
A.~S.~Eddington~\cite{1927stat.book.....E}, pag.~50.},
puzzled the astronomers for nearly 70 years~\cite{2009JHA....40..137H}.
A cursory look at the HR diagram in figure~\ref{fig:hr} clearly shows that, assuming
these system approximately behave like blackbodies, we are talking about
objects with a mass comparable to that of the Sun (as indicated by the motion
around the companions) squeezed in a sphere as big as a planet.

After R.~H.~Fowler pointed out, in 1926, that the electron degeneracy pressure was
in fact the key to solve the apparent paradox~\cite{1926MNRAS..87..114F}, it took
less than a decade to formulate a coherent theory of white dwarfs, and calculate
the mass upper limit that generally goes under the name of \emph{Chandrasekhar limit}.
As is often the case, the history behind these theoretical developments is an
interesting one~\cite{2008JHA....39..297N} and, although S.~Chandrasekhar is in
fact the one who first solved the equations for the hydrostatic equilibrium in a
compact star, providing a self-consistent treatment of the problem, at least two
other Physicists---E.~Stoner and W.~Anderson---provided
fundamental contributions\cite{1929Stoner,1929ZPhy...56..851A,1930LEDPM...9..944S}
that predate his work. They should be credited, in particular, with the realization
that it is the connection between special relativity and quantum mechanics that,
at the very fundamental level, leads to the existence of a mass limit for compact
stars.

The simplest possible model for a compact star is a uniform\sidenote{Sure enough,
this is a fairly crude model with no pretention of providing a self-consistent physical
description of a star, if only for the fact that a uniform sphere cannot be in
hydrostatic equilibrium, which a real star \emph{must} be. And yet, this toy setup
allows to reason on all the main physical ingredients of our problem in the simplest
possible way, without being carried away by subtle modeling details.}, electrically
neutral sphere of mass $M$ composed of completely ionized atoms where the inward
gravitational pressure generated by the nucleons is counteracted by the outward
degeneracy pressure of a gas of electrons at zero temperature.
Given the average number of nucleons per electrons, which we shall assume as
$\muave = 2$ in the following%
\sidenote{It is curious to note that all the original papers use $\muave = 2.5$
  (appropriate for completely ionized atoms of lead), and the numerical values of
  the relevant quantities generally differ from those given here. Our figure is
  appropriate for stars composed by $C$ and $O$, for which the number of neutrons
  is equal to the number of protons, but at the beginning of the twentieth century
  there were reasons to believe that stars were composed of much heavier elements.},
the total number of atoms $N$ is fully determined by the stellar mass
\begin{align}
  N = \frac{M}{\muave m_p}.
\end{align}
(we are neglecting the electron mass in the budget) and the only unknown left is
the the number density $n = N/V$ or, equivalently, the radius $R$ of the star
\begin{align}\label{eq:wd_radius_density}
  n = \frac{N}{V} = \frac{3M}{4\pi R^3 \muave m_p} \quad\text{or}\quad
  R = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi n \muave m_p} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}.
\end{align}
The basic idea is then to calculate the total kinetic energy density $u_F$ due to the
Fermi pressure and the total gravitational energy $u_G$
and impose the condition
\begin{align}\label{eq:wd_equilibrium_condition}
  \frac{d}{dn} (u_F + u_G) = 0
\end{align}
to calculate the resulting density $n$ (or, equivalently, the radius $R$) at the
equilibrium.

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/gravitational_energy.pgf}
  \caption{Calculation of the gravitational binding energy of a uniform sphere
    with constant density $\rho$.}
  \label{fig:sphere_gravitational_energy}
\end{marginfigure}

The gravitational self-energy density of a uniform sphere of mass $M$ and radius
$R$ can be readily calculated by integrating the contributions of a series of
thin layers as shown in figure~\ref{fig:sphere_gravitational_energy}:
\begin{align*}
  E_G = &- \int_0^R \frac{G}{r}
    \overbrace{4\pi \varrho r^2}^\text{shell}
    \underbrace{\frac{4}{3} \pi \varrho r^3}_\text{sphere} dr =
   - \frac{16 \pi^2}{15} G \varrho^2 R^5 = -\frac{3GM^2}{5R},
\end{align*}
and the corresponding energy density reads
\begin{align*}
  u_G = \frac{E_G}{V} =
  -\frac{3GM^2}{5R} \frac{3}{4\pi R^3} = -\frac{9}{20} \frac{GM^2}{R^4}.
\end{align*}
We can then use the expression for the stellar radius as a function of the number
density~\eqref{eq:wd_radius_density} to recast this as
\begin{align}
	u_G = -\frac{3}{5} \left( \frac{4}{3} \right)^\frac{1}{3} \pi^\frac{4}{3} G M^\frac{2}{3}
	\muave^\frac{4}{3} m_p^\frac{4}{3} n^\frac{4}{3}.
\end{align}

We have already calculated the expression for the kinetic energy density due to the
Fermi degeneracy pressure in appendix~\ref{chap:qstat} in both the non-relativitic
and the relativistic limit. In the first case it reads
\begin{align}
  u_F^{NR} = \left( \frac{h^3}{8\pi} \right)^\frac{2}{3}
	\frac{3^\frac{5}{3}}{10 m_e} n^\frac{5}{3}
\end{align}
and the equilibrium condition for the density~\eqref{eq:wd_equilibrium_condition},
irrespectively of how hard it is to keep track of all the numerical factors, is actually
trivial\sidenote{If you think about, the basic structure of~\eqref{eq:wd_equilibrium_condition}
is nothing more complicated than
$$
\dv{}{n}\left( c_1 n^\frac{5}{3} - c_2 n^\frac{4}{3} \right) = 0.
$$}, yielding the solution
\begin{align}\label{eq:wd_n_nr}
  n &= 256 \left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right)^3 \frac{G^3 \muave^4 m_p^4 m_e^3}{h^6} M^2.
\end{align}
This, in turn, can be recast in a closed expression for the radius $R$:
\begin{align}\label{eq:wd_radius_nr}
  R &= 2^{-\frac{10}{3}} \left( \frac{3}{\pi} \right)^\frac{4}{3}
  \frac{h^2}{G \muave^\frac{5}{3} m_p^\frac{5}{3} m_e} M^{-\frac{1}{3}}.
\end{align}
The key to success, here, is that $u_G$ and $u_F$ scale with different powers of the
number density $n$, and this implies that an equilibrium configuration will exist,
no matter what the value of $M$ is. (Incidentally, the equilibrium number density
$n$ is proportional to the square of the mass of the star in our case.)

\begin{marginfigure}
	\input{figures/white_dwarf_fermip_nr.pgf}
	\caption{Estimate for the Fermi momentum $\pF$ as a function of the mass of a
    white dwarf in the non-relativistic limit---this is calculated by simply
    plugging the non-relativistic expression for the number density~\eqref{eq:wd_n_nr}
    into the formula for the Fermi momentum~\eqref{eq:fermi_momentum}. We note
    that the hypothesis that the electrons in the Fermi gas are not relativistic
    $\pF \ll m_e c$, in fact, does not hold over most of the mass range of
    interest.}
    \label{fig:wd_fermip_nr}
\end{marginfigure}

For a $1~M_\odot$ star, \eqref{eq:wd_n_nr} yields a number density
$n \approx 3.9 \times 10^{29}$~cm$^{-3}$, or a mass density
$\rho = n \muave m_p \approx 1.3 \times 10^6$~g~cm$^{-3}$.
(Yes: this is in excess of a tonne per cubic centimeter, and the density of white
dwarfs can in fact be high enough for their radiation to be gravitationally red-shifted,
as first measured for Sirius~B in 1925~\cite{1925PNAS...11..382A}.) The corresponding
radius~\eqref{eq:wd_radius_nr} is roughly $7200$~km.

While these figures are roughly in the right ballpark, given the early estimates
of the density at the core of the classical white dwarfs, it is maybe more
interesting to note that the corresponding Fermi momentum~\eqref{eq:fermi_momentum}
is $\pF \approx 450$~keV/c. To put things in context, figure~\ref{fig:wd_fermip_nr}
illustrates how the Fermi momentum, calculated in the non-relativistic regime,
scales with the stellar mass. While the non-relativistic approximation might
hold up for a $0.1~M_\odot$ white dwarf, it is clear that the basic assumption of
our reasoning is not verified at the high-end of the mass spectrum of interest.

It was in fact W.~Anderson in 1930~\cite{1929ZPhy...56..851A} who first pointed
out that the dynamical effect of special relativity could not be neglected.
Although, in retrospect, Anderson's approach to the problem was fundamentally
flawed, shortly after his paper Stoner worked out the uniform sphere problem in
a fully relativistic approach~\cite{1930LEDPM...9..944S}. This was hardly a mere
incremental improvement over the previous model, as incorporating the relativistic
effects gives birth to a completely new phenomenon: the existence of a hard mass
limit above which the equilibrium~\ref{eq:wd_equilibrium_condition} simply cannot
hold. Perhaps the easiest way to see this is to note that in the ultra-relativistic
regime the energy density due to the Fermi degeneracy pressure
\begin{align*}
	U_F^{UR} = \left( \frac{h^3}{8\pi} \right)^\frac{1}{3}
	\frac{3^\frac{4}{3} c}{4} n^\frac{4}{3}
\end{align*}
scales with the same power of $n$ of the gravitational energy density $u_G$, and the
equilibrium condition is never reached! It follows that the electron kinetic
energy cannot increase indefinitely within equilibrium conditions: there must be
a mass threshold above which the electron degeneracy pressure is unable to counteract
the gravitational pressure.

The full relativistic calculation of the kinetic term, as it turns out, can be solved
analytically in closed form, but the details of the calculation are not very inspiring.
What is interesting is the resulting limiting mass\sidenote{Owing to the value
$\muave = 2.5$ chosen for the average molecular weight of the star interior, the value
quoted in the original paper is actually $1.10~M_\odot$.}
\begin{align}\label{eq:wd_mass_limit_stoner}
  M_{L}^\text{St} = \frac{3}{4\pi} \left( \frac{5}{4} \right)^\frac{3}{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \left( \frac{hc}{G} \right)^\frac{3}{2} \frac{1}{\muave^2 m_p^2} \approx 1.72~M_\odot.
\end{align}
This is about as far as the n\"aive uniform-sphere model goes, and, given the
crudeness of the calculation, one might argue it is even surprising that it
overshoot the currently accepted value by only 20\%.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\input{figures/white_dwarf_mass_radius.pgf}
	\caption{White dwarf radius as a function of the mass. The black solid line
    represents the result of the original calculation in the uniform-sphere
    approximation by Stoner\cite{1930LEDPM...9..944S}, obtained by inverting
    equation~\eqref{eq:wd_stoner_mass_relation}, while the gray line is the
    corresponding non-relativistic limit---where there is no limiting mass.

    by numerically integrating the solution of the differential equations for
    the hydrostatic equilibrium.}
    \label{fig:wd_mass_radius}
\end{figure}

At about the same time then 19-years old S.~Chandrasekhar started working on the
solution of the differential equations for the hydrostatic equilibrium of compact
stars, both in the non-relativistic and in the ultra-relativistic limits, which
he first published in 1931~\cite{1931MNRAS..91..456C}. The full treatment of the
stellar equilibrium is too complex to be summarized here, but it is worth mentioning
that a cryptic, two-pages long paper published by Chandrasekhar in the same
year~\cite{1931ApJ....74...81C} provides the first occurrence of what would
be later called the \emph{Chandrasekhar limit}%
\sidenote{Like Stoner, Chandrasekhar too assumed $\muave = 2.5$, and the value
  quoted in the original paper is $0.91~M_\odot$.
  Note that $\omega_3^0 \approx 2.018236$ is a mere numerical constant connected
  with the solution of a particular class of differential equations.}
\begin{align}\label{eq:wd_mass_limit_chandra}
  M_{L}^\text{Ch} = \omega_3^0 \frac{\sqrt{3\pi}}{2}
  \left( \frac{hc}{2\pi G} \right)^\frac{3}{2} \frac{1}{\muave^2 m_p^2} \approx 1.44~M_\odot.
\end{align}
which is surprisingly similar, both in the form and in the numerical value, to
that derived by Stoner in a much simpler setup.
It was not until 1935 that Chandrasekhar published a full relativistic treatment
of the problem, providing numerical estimates for the relation between the radius
and the mass for a realistic star model~\cite{1935MNRAS..95..207C}, as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:wd_mass_radius}.

The existence of a mass limit for a white dwarf is not a mere curiosity, as it
hints at the fact that more massive stars must collapse in even denser states of
matter than a degenerate electron gas. Perhaps the skepticism with which the very
idea was met at the beginning is best illustrated by the famous public controversy
between Eddington and Chandrasekhar that unfolded in the 1930s\sidenote{We now
believe that the vast majority of stars---those with initial masses lower
than $\approx 10~M_\odot$---become white dwarfs when they cannot fuse nuclear
elements in the core anymore. Thousands of white dwarfs are known, with a mass
distribution peaking at $\approx 0.6~M_\odot$, and with a low-mass cut at
$\approx 0.6~M_\odot$, for which it would take more than the age of the universe
for the progenitors to leave the main sequence.}.


\subsection{Supernov\ae}
\label{sec:supernovae}

Supernov\ae\ (SN\ae) are powerful star explosions marking the endpoint of the stellar
evolution for particular classes of stars. Although the peak optical luminosity of a
supernova can be comparable to that of the host galaxy, the fraction of stars that
can undergo this evolutionary phase is relatively small (essentially massive stars,
or stars in binary systems with at least a white dwarf). This, combined with the relatively
short fading timescale (weeks to months) make the chances of being able to see such
an event with the naked eye slim: about a dozen of SN\ae\ are documented in the
history of pre-telescope astronomy, the first of which is SN~185\sidenote{Supernov\ae\
are typically identified by the year of their  explosion, possibly followed by a
lowercase letter to distinguish between events within the same calendar year.},
observed and recorded by Chinese astronomers. The most famous historical supernov\ae\
include SN~1006 (probably the largest ever observed), SN~1054 (also know as the Crab),
SN~1572 (Tycho's SN) and SN~1604 (Kepler's SN), all of which continue to be object
of detailed studies at all wavelengths.

    come out with all sorts of refinements over this basic scheme, but as usual
    this is hardly relevant for our limited scope.}
\end{marginfigure}

Supernovae are customarily classified based on the optical spectra near the maximum
light. Historically the first broad categorization of SN\ae\ was proposed by
Minkowski, based on the absence (Type~I) or presence (Type~II) of hydrogen absorption
lines. About forty years later it was realized, on the base of an ever-growing number
of high-quality optical spectra, that Type~I SN\ae\ encompassed qualitatively
different objects, which are generally referred as Type~Ia, showing a strong
silicon absorption at 6150~\AA, and Type~Ib and Ic, with no Si feature (the
latter differing for the presence or no of He absorption lines).

While the historical classification of supernov\ae\ is still widespread, it is fair to
say that it is confusing in many respects, as nowadays it is commonly accepted that
Type~II, Type~Ib and Type~Ic SN\ae\ result from the core-collapse of massive stars,
while Type~Ia SN\ae\ are the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs accreting matter
from a companion in a binary system. (It follows that, in many respects, Type~II,
Type~Ib and Type~Ic are more similar to each other than any ot them is to Type~Ia.)


\subsubsection{Type~Ia SN\ae\ as standard candles}

As we said, a Type~Ia supernova occurs when a carbon-oxygen\sidenote{The chemical
composition of the core of the star is relevant in this context because carbon fusion
is the process triggering the runaway and preventing the star from reaching the
Chandrasekhar mass and collapsing into a neutron star.} white dwarf in a binary system
gradually accretes matter from the companion, up to the point when the temperature
becomes high enough to ignite carbon fusion and the star undergoes a thermonuclear
runaway. (Remember: for degenerate stars the degeneracy pressure does not depend
on the temperature, and the negative feedback that is instrumental in keeping regular
stars in equilibrium just does not apply.) The runaway is triggered when the mass
of the star gets very close (but not quite equal to) the Chandrasekhar limit, and
within a few seconds a substantial fraction of the mass of the core is fused into
heavier elements, releasing such a large amount of energy in such a short time that
the star is basically dissolved in a shock wave that leaves nothing behind.

Since the process we have just described is a threshold process taking place at a very
specific critical mass, all Type~Ia supernov\ae\ produce a fairly similar peak luminosity,
which is way they are so interesting as standard candles: by measuring the apparent
magnitude and assuming a standard value for the total energy release\sidenote{The typical
absolute magnitude of Type~Ia supernovae is $M_v = -19.3$, with little variations.},
one can measure the distance to the host galaxy via the inverse-square law.
We shall come back to this in section~\ref{sec:}.

The order of magnitude for the overall energy output can be estimated by assuming
that one solar mass of material undergoes fusion, with an average energy release
$Q \approx 1$~MeV per nucleon
\begin{align}
	E_\text{Ia} \sim \frac{M_\odot Q}{m_p} \approx 10^{51}~\text{erg}.
\end{align}
The total radiated energy, which can be measured by simply integrating the light curve
(corrected for the distance) over the prompt phase, turns out to be some two orders
of magnitude smaller, indicating that the vast majority of the energy released in the
explosion goes actually into the kinetic energy of the ejecta\sidenote{As it turns out,
and unlike the case of core-collapse supernov\ae, the energy emitted in the form of
neutrinos is also subdominant in this case.}. The initial velocity of the latter
can be simply estimated by
\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{2} M_\odot v_\text{ej}^2 = E_\text{Ia}
  \quad\text{or}\quad
  v_\text{ej} = \sqrt{\frac{2 E_\text{Ia}}{M_\odot}} \approx 10,000~\text{km~s}^{-1}.
\end{align}
As we shall see in section~\ref{sec}, this will be relevant for the discussion of
the acceleration of cosmic rays in shocks.


\subsubsection{Core-collapse supernov\ae}

While some of the aspects we have discussed for Type~Ia supernov\ae\ do qualitatively
apply to their core-collapsed cousins, there is one key feature that is specific
to the latter---the explosion is not triggered by a thermonuclear runaway just
before the Chandrasekhar limit is reached. Instead, when the mass of the core
exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, the electron degeneracy pressure is no more sufficient
to counterbalance the gravitational force, and the core starts collapsing. The detail
of the process depends on the specific of the environment (e.g., the mass and
chemical composition of the star), but essentially the inner density and temperature
become so high that the inverse beta decay
\begin{align}
  p + e^- \rightarrow n + \nu_e
\end{align}
comes into play, converting protons into neutrons, and depleting the core from
electrons. This sometimes goes under the name of \emph{de-leptonization}, and it makes
all the difference in the world, because all of a sudden the electron degeneracy
pressure vanishes and all that is possibly left is the degeneracy pressure of neutrons
which, as we have seen, is 2000~times smaller.

We shall look into this process more closely in chapter~\ref{chap:nu}, but we anticipate
two key differences with respect to the Type~Ia scenario we have described in the
previous section: (i) in addition to the ejecta, the supernova explosion leaves a
compact object behind---either a \emph{neutron star} or a \emph{black hole}, depending
on the mass of the progenitor---which is the remnant of the stella collapse; and (ii)
the vast majority of the energy (typically of the order of $10^{53}$~erg) in this case is
carried away by the neutrinos produced in the de-leptonization, to which the exploding
environment is largely transparent.

\subsection{Neutron stars}
\label{sec:neutron_stars}

Although anecdotal evidence can be found in the literature that Lev~Landau
might have provided the first theoretical prediction of the existence of
nuclei-like dense stars~\cite{1932PhyZS...1..285L} (interestingly enough, predating
the discovery of the neutron), the term \emph{neutron star}%
\marginnote{\emph{With all reserve we advance the view that a super-nova represents
  the transition of an ordinary star into a neutron star, consisting mainly of
  neutrons. Such a star may possess a very small radius and an extremely high density.
  As neutrons can be packed much more closely than ordinary nuclei and electrons,
  the "gravitational packing" energy in a cold neutron star may become very large,
  and, under certain circumstances, may far exceed the ordinary nuclear packing
  fractions. A neutron star would therefore represent the most stable configuration
  of matter as such.}\\[10pt]Baade and Zwicky~\cite{1934PNAS...20..259B}.}
first appeared in a short paper by Walter~Baade and Fritz~Zwicky published in
1934~\cite{1934PNAS...20..259B}, and providing no quantitative detail at all about
the underlying physical mechanism.

%Calculate the density at which this happens, that is, when the Fermi momentum is
%high enough. The number should be around $1.2 \times 10^7$~g~cm$^{-3}$, which is
%about an order of magnitude larger than the typical density for a white dwarf.

There is one interesting aspect that emerges immediately, and we have touched upon
several times alredy: since the Fermi degeneracy pressure is inversely proportional
to the mass of the fermion, it will be about 2000~times smaller for neutrons,
compared to electrons. That is, a neutron star is bound to be fairly small. If we
imagine repeating the basic reasoning that went into the estimation of the radius
of a white dwarf~\eqref{eq:wd_radius_nr}\sidenote{Note that was in the non-relativistic
limit, but since we're talking orders of magnitude we'll just take it.} assuming
that the neutrons are now providing the degeneracy pressure, we end up with
\begin{align}
  \frac{R_\text{NS}}{R_\text{WD}} = \frac{m_e}{m_n} \muave^\frac{5}{3}
  \approx 1.7 \times 10^{-3}.
\end{align}
Note that in this case is the same fermions (the neutrons) that provide both the
degeneracy pressure and the mass of the star, so the equivalent of $\muave$, that
was the average number of electrons per nucleon for a white dwarfs, is now simply $1$.

Assuming that a typical white dwarf has a radius of the order of the Earth radius,
a typical neutron star would have a radius of $\sim 10$~km, with an astonishing density
of $\sim 4 \times 10^{14}$~g~cm$^{-3}$ (that is, in excess of that of an atomic
nucleus) and a surface gravity of $\sim 10^{12}$~m~s$^{-2}$. It is no
surprise that, under these conditions, the Newtonian mechanics is totally inadequate,
and one must correctly incorporate the effects of general relativity\sidenote{The
escape velocity at the surface of a neutron predicted by Newtonian mechanics would be
$$
	v_\text{esc} = \sqrt{\frac{2G M}{R}} \approx 0.52~c!
$$
}.

The first quantitative calculation for the equilibrium of a neutron star where
done by Oppenheimer and Volkoff~\cite{1939PhRv...55..374O}, building up on ideas
from Tolman~\cite{1939PhRv...55..364T}. The resulting mass limit of 0.7~$M_\odot$
was lower than the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs, and modern calculations,
including the effects of strong interactions, place it between 1.5 and 3~$M_\odot$
for a non-rotating neutron star. For the sake of the discussion, in the following
we shall refer to a \emph{canonical neutron star} as a uniform sphere of mass
$M = 1.4~M_\odot$ and radius $R = 10$~km\sidenote{Real mileage
might vary, and different neautron stars will have different masses, radii, and
density profiles. With the highest neutron star masses staning at bout $2~M_\odot$,
it is commonly accepted that any NS of mass greater that $3~M_\odot$ would collapse
into a black hole.}.

There is a few fun facts about neutron stars that will turn out to be relevant
in the following. If we treat a star as a rigid, uniform sphere with a moment of
inertia\sidenote{The basic scaling with the mass and the radius of the star
$$
  I \propto M R^2
$$
holds in the general case, with the constant of proportionality depending on the
actual radial distribution of the mass inside the star.}
\begin{align*}
	I = \frac{2}{5} MR^2
\end{align*}
and we assume that the angular momentum $I\Omega$ is conserved in the contraction
and collapse of the star, we get a relation between the angular velocities at the
beginning and the end of the process:
\begin{align}
	R^2_i \Omega_i = R^2_f \Omega_f
	\quad \text{or} \quad
	\Omega_f = \left( \frac{R_i}{R_f} \right)^2 \Omega_i
\end{align}
If we now imagine starting with a star like the Sun and have it rigidly collapse
to a neutron star, the initial period of 24.47~days would be reduced by a spectacular
factor $(\nicefrac{R_\odot}{R_\text{NS}})^2 \approx 10^{10}$ to less than~1~ms!
This is largely fictional, but it is true that, at least potentially, neutron stars
can spin very fast, and in fact \emph{millisecond pulsars} do exist\sidenote{Note
that for a period of 1~ms, a point on the neutron star surface would rotate at a
tangential speed of
$$
	v = \frac{2\pi R}{P} \approx 0.23~c!
$$
}.

Interestingly enough, by the Alfven theorem, the magnetic flux $BR^2$ is also conserved
in the collapse\sidenote{This is a basic consequence that, through the collapse, the
material of the star behaves like a plasma, and is characterized by a high
electrical conductivity, so that the process takes place with no dissipation.},
and so the magnetic field at the surface is also amplified by the same factor $10^{10}$.
If we start with a magnetic field of 1~G, such as the one of the Sun, we end up
to a spectacular figure of $10^{10}$~G after the collapse. Again, simplistic as
the argument is, we are still in the land of plausible things, as pulsars do tend
to have intense magnetic fields, and examples with spectacular magnetic fields are known.



\subsection{Pulsars}
\label{sec:pulsars}

It is interesting to calculate the bolometric luminosity for our canonical neutron
star, assuming a surface temperature of a million of degrees K.
This comes to be around 20\% of the luminosity of the Sun, but according to Wien
displacement law it peaks in X-rays\sidenote{And it is in fact from modern X-ray
measurements (in addition to theoretical modeling) that we have a good grasp on
NS temperatures.}, at about $250$~eV. It is fair to say that in the 1930s nobody
was holding their breadth on the fact that such an object would be ever detectable.

It was in 1967 that Pacini~\cite{1967Natur.216..567P} pointed out that rapidly
rotating, magnetized neutron stars might emit radio waves. The basic argument is
that, since the geometry of the mass loss in the supernova explosion is unlikely
to be perfectly spherical, the angle between the magnetic field direction (e.g.,
the dipole axis if we assume the field to be dipolar) and the rotation axis is
likely to be arbitrary. In order words, we are likely dealing with an oblique rotator,
and the misalignment between the two axes would cause the system to emit low-energy
electromagnetic radiation by the lighthouse effect.

Needless to say, pulsars were in fact discovered at about the same time, in the
form of a periodic radio signal (with $P = 1.337$~s) from a specific position in
the sky detected during a sky survey at 81.5~MHz~\cite{1968Natur.217..709H}.
Today we know thousands of pulsars, with periods between $\sim 1$~ms and $\sim 10$~s,
which are routinely studied at all wavelengths, from radio to gamma rays.

% Very interesting and informative page here.
% https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch6.html

If we interpret the pulsation as a result of the rapid rotation of a neutron star,
we immediately have an interesting bound on the average density of the object by
just requiring that the centrifugal force experienced by a point at the equator does
not exceed the gravitational attraction by the rest of the star:
\begin{align}\label{eq:pulsar_minimum_density}
	\Omega^2 R < \frac{GM}{R^2} = \frac{4\pi}{3} G R \density \quad\text{or}\quad
  \density > \frac{3 \Omega^2}{4\pi G} = \frac{3\pi}{GP^2}.
\end{align}

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/pulsar_minimum_density.pgf}
  \caption{Minimum density of a neutron star as a function of the period
    from~\eqref{eq:pulsar_minimum_density}.}
  \label{fig:pulsar_minimum_density}
\end{marginfigure}

The basic scaling of the bound is shown in figure~\ref{fig:pulsar_minimum_density}.
The first pulsar discovered had a period $P = 1.3$~s, so its mean density is at
least $8.4 \times 10^7$~g~cm$^{-3}$, which is in line with the typical figure for
a white dwarf. For the Crab pulsar, whose period is $33$~ms, the bound is much
more stringent ($1.3 \times 10^{11}$~g~cm$^{-3}$), and for the fastest known pulsar
($P = 1.4$~ms) it becomes $\density_\text{NS} > 7.2 \times 10^{13}$~g~cm$^{-3}$,
which is indeed comparable with the density of nuclear matter.

Although pulsars are generally regarded as very precise cosmic clocks, it was realized
soon after their discovery that their periods do increase with time, with period
derivatives $\dot{P}$ varying over more than ten orders of magnitude\sidenote{In general,
the pulsar period as a function of time can be expanded ina Taylor series
$$
  P(t) = P_0 + \dot{P} t + \frac{1}{2} \ddot{P} t^2 + \cdots
$$
but the terms beyond the first derivative are generally negligible. (The second
derivative is only measured for a handful of the brightest pulsars.)
We explicitely note that the time derivative of the period
$$
  \dot{P} = \dv{P}{t}
$$
is a dimensionless number, although occasionally you will find it indicated in the
literature with funny units s~s$^{-1}$,}, from $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-21}$. This is
generally understood as the result of the power output by the pulsar in magnetic
dipole radiation, which in turn is responsible for the overall electromagnetic
radiation from the system. For a uniformly magnetized sphere with radius $R$ and
surface magnetic field strength $B$ the radiated power is given by
\begin{align}
  P_\text{rad} = \frac{2}{3c^3} (BR^3 \sin\alpha)^2 \left( \frac{2\pi}{P} \right)^4 <
  \frac{2B^2 R^6}{3c^3} \left( \frac{2\pi}{P} \right)^4
\end{align}
(Here $\alpha$ is the inclination angle of the magnetic dipole with respect to the
rotation axis, which is generally not measured directly; it goes without saying,
the output power vanishes when the dipole is aligned with the rotation axis and
is maximum when the two are orthogonal.)

\begin{marginfigure}
  \input{figures/pulsar_rotational_energy.pgf}
  \caption{Rotational kinetic energy of a neutron star as a function of the
    period~\eqref{eq:pulsar_rotational_energy}.}
  \label{fig:pulsar_rotational_energy}
\end{marginfigure}

The rotational kinetic energy of our canonical (uniform) neutron star can be written as
\begin{align}\label{eq:pulsar_rotational_energy}
  E_\text{rot} = \frac{1}{2} I \Omega^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{5} \frac{M R^2}{P^2},
\end{align}
which for the Crab pulsar amount to a very respectable $2 \times 10^{49}$~erg.
The time derivative of the rotational energy, which is customarily called the
\emph{spin-down luminosity}, reads
\begin{align*}
  -\dot{E}_\text{rot} = -I \Omega\dot{\Omega} = -\frac{4\pi^2 I\dot{P}}{P^3}.
\end{align*}
Note this is not to be confused with the actual pulsar luminosity in any particular
band. The very-long-wavelength magnetic dipole radiation does not propagate very far
and is mostly heating up and powering the surrounding environment, which in turn
emits electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths with a bolometric luminosity
that is comparable with the spin-down luminosity. (For the Crab pulsar the spin-down
luminosity amounts to $4 \times 10^{38}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, or about $100,000$ the luminosity
of the Sun, which is more than 8~orders of magnitude higher than the average
radio pulse luminosity of the pulsar.)

If we know equate the spin-down luminosity to the magnetic dipole power, we can
derive a constraint on the minimum magnetic field at the NS surface for the case
of an orthogonal rotator
\begin{align}
  B > B\sin\alpha = \left( \frac{3c^3 I}{8\pi^2 R^6} \right)^\frac{1}{2}
  \left( P\dot{P}\right)^\frac{1}{2},
\end{align}
which is generally referred to as the \emph{characteristic magnetic field}. For the
Crab pulsar this amounts to a minimum surface field of $4 \times 10^{12}$~G.

If we assume that the quantity $B\sin\alpha$ does not change significantly through
the lifetime of the pulsar, since $I$ and $R$ are not expected to change either,
we immediately realize that $P\dot{P}$ is constant. But than we can integrate
the pulsar period over the pulsar lifetime $\tau$, assuming an initial period $P_0$
at the time the pulsar was born
\begin{align*}
  \frac{P^2 - P_0^2}{2} = \int_{P_0}^P P dP = \int_0^\tau P \dot{P} dt =
  P \dot{P} \int_0^\tau dt = P \dot{P} \tau.
\end{align*}
Of course we don't know $P_0$, but if the pulsar is old enough for the current period
to be much longer than the initial one ($P \gg P_0$), the above equation simplifies
yielding the nice relation for the \emph{characteristic age}
\begin{align}
  \tau = \frac{P}{2\dot{P}}.
\end{align}
(The characteristic age for the Crab pulsar is 1250~years, which is only slightly
larger than time elapsed by the explosion of the supernova, which historical records
place at 1054~AD.)

Pulsars are customarily represented in a $P$-$\dot{P}$ diagram such as the one
shown in figure~\ref{fig:pulsar_ppdot}, where the surface magnetic field and
characteristic age inferred from the period and period derivative can be illustrated
as diagonal grids. The pulsars with periods smaller than $\sim 10$~ms are generally
referred to as \emph{millisecond pulsars}, and are believed to be old objects,
recycled through the accretion of matter (and angular momentum) from a companion
in a binary system\sidenote{It goes without saying: the characteristic age and
magnetic field for millisecond pulsars should be taken \emph{cum grano salis}}.

\section{Galaxies}
\label{sec:galaxies}

Galaxies are gravitationally-bound systems comprised of stars, stellar remnants,
interstellar gas and dust, in addition to \emph{dark-matter}---more on this (much)
later, as this is actually one of the main aspects we shall try and cover in this
writeup. Needless to say, we live in our own galaxy, which is called the Milky Way.

Galaxies come in all forms and shapes, and their morphology is customarily categorized
in three large groups: elliptical, spiral and irregular, with most spiral galaxies
structured in a central bulge and a disk. They typically range between 1~kpc and
100~kp in diameter and the number or stars orbiting around the center of mass of
the system range from $10^3$ for dwarf galaxies to $10^{14}$ for super-giants.
The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy with a diameter of 27~kpc, hosting a few $10^{11}$
stars. Galaxies tend to be organized in larger structures (groups, clusters and
super-clusters)\sidenote{The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which in turn
belongs to the Virgo supercluster. The closest independent galaxy is Andromeda (M~31)
at about 2.5~Mpc.}, with distances between individual galaxies being typically of
the order of Mpc.


\subsection{Galaxy rotation curves}

The \emph{rotation curve} of a galaxy is the relation $v(r)$ expressing the radial
velocity $v$ that a star in a galaxy must have to maintain a circular orbit at a
specified distance from the center. Rotation curves are customarily measured using the
Doppler shift of the stars, and provide invaluable information about the gravitational
potential within the system.

In a simple, spherical-symmetric setting the orbital velocity of a star at a given
distance $r$ from the center of the galaxy is only determined by the total mass
enclosed within a sphere of radius $r$, i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{G M(r)}{r^2}
  \quad\text{or}\quad
  v = \left(\frac{GM(r)}{r}\right)^\frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation*}
(Conversely, if we measure the rotation curve, we are effectively mapping the radial
distribution of matter within the galaxy.)

\begin{marginfigure}
	\input{figures/galaxy_rotation.pgf}
	\caption{Toy model for a galaxy rotation curve~\eqref{eq:galaxy_rotation}, based
		on the assumption that the mass of the galaxy is concentrated in the bulge.}
	\label{fig:galaxy_rotation}
\end{marginfigure}

In a toy model where we imagine a spiral galaxy as a relatively small, homogeneous
central bulge with radius $R_b$ and a thin disk with radius $R_d > R_b$, with the
majority of the mass concentrated in the bulge, it is straightforward to see that
the rotation curve should increase linearly within the latter and then decrease
as $\nicefrac{1}{\sqrt{r}}$ for larger radii.
\begin{align}\label{eq:galaxy_rotation}
  v(r) \propto \begin{cases}
    r & \quad\text{for}~r \leq R_b\\
    r^{-\frac{1}{2}} & \quad\text{for}~r > R_b.
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
Now, this is clearly an oversimplification by all means, but what is generally true
is that, as long we admit that the mass in the outer parts of the disk is small
compared to that in the bulge, the conclusion holds true that the rotation curve
should go to zero with some power of $r$ not very different from $-\nicefrac{1}{2}$
for large radii. This is at odd with the observed rotation curves in many galaxies,
remaining relatively constant (or even increasing) up to significantly larger radii
than one would expect, based on the content of visible matter.

This is, historically, the first evidence for the existence of dark matter, and
we shall come back to this in a completely different context in chapter~\ref{chap:cosmo}.


\subsection{The Milky Way}

The Milky Way appears like a pale band of light to the naked eye, and this is where
its name derives from. It was not until Galileo pointed its telescope towards the
heavens that it became clear that it was an enormous collection of individual
stars. The first attempts at mapping the structure of the milky way, largely due
to the difficulties in disentangling the effects on stellar extinction.

Our current understanding of the Milky Way is somewhat resembling the sketch in
figure~\ref{fig:milky_way}, with a disk of about 50~kpc in diameter\sidenote{As we shall
see in a second, there is no hard boundary, here, and this figure should be understood
as merely indicating a characteristic length.}, and the Sun
lying within the disk at about $\nicefrac{2}{3}$ of the galactic radius towards the
outskirts, or about 8~kpc from the galactic center.

	\label{fig:milky_way}
\end{figure}

The disk is actually composed of at least two components---the thin disk and the
thick disck---both of which can be roughly modeled as continuous distributions
\begin{align}
	n(r, z) = n_0 e^{-\frac{r}{r_0}} e^{-\frac{z}{z_0}},
\end{align}
where the radial scale is of the order of $r_0 \approx 3.5$~kp and the vertical
scale lengths are of the order of 300~pc for the thin disk and 1.5~kp for the thick
disk.

The galactic bulge constitutes an independent component of the Milky Way, with a
complex, non-spherical shape and a mean radius of about 1~kpc. The total mass of the
bulge is believed to be of the order of $10^{10}~M_\odot$, which is about $20\%$ of
the mass in the disk (and predominantly the think disk).

The last luminous component of the galaxy is the stella halo, mostly composed of
globular clusters and field stars, with large velocity components perpendicular to the
galactic plane.
(And, of course, we believe the MIlky Way is embedded in a dark matter halo---but we
won't elaborate further on the structure of this halo, and we shall return to the
general subject of dark matter in chapter~\ref{chap:cosmo}.)


\subsection{The interstellar medium}

The matter and radiation fields that are present in the space between stars within
the Milky Way goes under the name of \emph{interstellar medium}, or
ISM\sidenote{Other galaxies have their own insterstellar
medium, too}.
The ISM in mainly composed by Hydrogen ($\sim 90\%$ in number) and Helium
($\sim 10\%$ in number), with small traces of heavier elements\sidenote{Keep in mind
that astronomers are accustomed to call \emph{metals} anything that is heavier
than helium.}. It comes in different phases (ionized, atomic, molecular), depending
on the local temperature. The latter ranges from tens (in cold molecular clouds)
to millions (in the hot ionized medium) of degrees~K, with a corresponding number
density that goes from $\sim 10^6$ to $10^{-4}$.

The interstellar space is also host of a magnetic field, that is know to possess
at least two components: a \emph{large-scale} (or \emph{regular}) field that is
coherent over scale lengths of the order ot the dimensions of the galaxy, and
\emph{small-scale} (or \emph{random}) component that is connected to the turbulence
of the interstellar medium~\cite{Haverkorn2015}. Both are important for the energy
balance of the galaxy, and for the propagation of charged particles.

The strength of the large scale galactic magnetic field is mainly inferred from
Faraday rotation measurements of pulsars and is, on average, of the order of 1--2~$\mu$G,
although it is larger $\sim 6~\mu$G in the solar neighborhood and even larger toward
the galactic center. The actual morphology of the field is still matter of debate,
although some general features---most notably, the fact that it follows the spiral
arms---seem to be commonly accepted.

The strength of the random magnetic field is also of the order of a few $\mu$G,
and its power spectrum is significantly more difficult to constraint. As we shall
see, the small-scale magnetic field in discrete objects such as supernova remnants
is a crucial ingredient of the diffusive-shock acceleration paradigm, which is one
of the most accredited ideas to explain the acceleration of galactic cosmic rays.

\section{The Universe at the largest scales}
\label{sec:universe_on_large_scales}

One of the most striking features that emerge when we look at the universe on its
largest scales, is that it looks the same in all directions. (In slightly more technical
terms the universe is \emph{isotropic}).

Now, taken at face value, this is largely counter-intuitive, to use an euphemism.
A cursory look at our surrounding, wherever we happen to find ourselves, is enough
to convince us that what we see does not look isotropic at all. And yet, on scales
larger than 100~Mpc (remember, this corresponds to 2,000 times the diameter of the
Milky Way), we have several independent pieces of evidence that the universe is
approximately isotropic. Deep optical survey measuring the spatial distribution of
distant galaxies are one, and the \emph{cosmic-microwave background}, which we shall
return to several times in the following is another (and, possibly, even more compelling)
one.

Since we are at it we note that, although isotropy and homogeneity are two very
different things\sidenote{Saying that the universe is isotropic means that it looks
the same in all directions---there are no preferred directions. Saying that it is
homogeneous means that it looks the same in all locations---there are priviledged
positions. In general one property does not imply the other, altough the two are
clearly related in that, e.g., if the universe is isotropic around any point, then
it is bound to be homogeneous, too.}. Nonetheless, if we accept the fact that there
is nothing special in our location in the universe (a stance that goes under the name
of \emph{Copernican principle}) then we are forced to accept that the experimental
evidence that the universe \emph{around us} is isotropic implies that the latter is
homogeneous, too.
The combination of the two things (the universe is isotropic \emph{and} homogeneous)
is called the \emph{cosmological principle}. As we shall see in chapter~\ref{chap:cosmo},
simple as it is, the cosmological principle allows to draw a surprising amount of
far-reaching consequences.


\subsection{The cosmic microwave background}

The cosmic-microwave background (CMB) is microwave radiation pervading the universe
with a spectrum that, to an astounding accuracy, is that of a blackbody with a
temperature of $2.7255^\circ$~k . One of the most striking features of the CMB is its
isotropy\sidenote{The CMB is not, in fact, \emph{perfectly} isotropic, and nobody
expected it to be. The relative temperature fluctuations of the CMB are at the
level of $10^{-5}$ and encode important cosmological information.},
which we have in fact cited at the beginning of this section as one of the most
compelling experimental evidences that the universe is isotropic at large scales.

\keyfigures{CMB}{
	Temperature: $2.7255^\circ$~k\\
	Peak energy: $3.74 \times 10^{-4}$~eV\\
	$\subcmb{n} \approx 410$~cm$^{-3}$\\
	$\subcmb{\density} \approx 0.2606$~eV~cm$^{-3}$
}

Everything we have said about the Planck distribution in appendix~\ref{chap:qstats}
holds for the CMB. The differential number density peaks at $3.74 \times 10^{-4}$~eV,
but due to the right tail in the distribution the average photon energy is
$6.62 \times 10^{-4}$~eV. The total number density is $410$~cm$^{-3}$ and the total
energy density $0.2606$~eV~cm$^{-3}$. We note that this is at the level of $10^{-4}$
of the critical energy density we have calculated in section~\ref{sec:hubble_law},
i.e., the CMB is not a dominant contributor to the energy budget of the contemporary
universe (although, as we shall see, it was in earlier phase of the evolution of the
universe).

The very existence of the CMB is cosmologically very important, and it is fair to
say that it was its discovery by Penzias and Wilson in 1965 that made the scale
in the big debate between the steady-state model and the big-bang model tip in favor
of the latter. In a big-bang scenario, as we shall see in details, the presence
of a relic of electromagnetic radiation arise natural from the photon decoupling
from the thermal bath at the point in time when electrons and protons combine to
form neutral atoms, so that the bath itself becomes transparent to radiation.


\subsection{The extragalactic background light}

The CMB is not the only form of radiation pervading the universe. The second most
energetic diffuse background is the so-called \emph{extragalactic background light},
with a much more mundane origin---it is the light produced by all luminous objects,
in the universe, accumulated over the cosmic history, and extends over the entire
electromagnetic spectrum, up to the highest-energy gamma rays, as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:ebl}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \input{figures/ebl.pgf}
  \caption{Approximate spectrum of the extragalactic background light, from
		radio to gamma rays~\cite{}.}
  \label{fig:ebl}
\end{figure}

When compared with the CMB, the combined energy density of all the EBL components
only amounts to 5--10\% of the former, indicating the energy density of the CMB
is (much) larger than the energy density of all the light produced by all the stars
in the history of the universe. So much so that, to a first approximation, the
EBL can be just neglected from a cosmological standpoint. And yet we shall see in
section~\ref{sec:universe_opacity} that it is fundamental for very-high-energy
gamma-ray astronomy, as it is the component that renders the universe opaque to
photons above $~\sim 100$~GeV.
