\chapter*{Preface}

These lecture notes are being developed in support of the Astroparticle Physics
course I am teaching at the University of Pisa (for the first time) during the
academic year 2024--2025.

"Being developed" as in "this will change daily over the course of the next
semester, and it is guaranteed to contain errors." I mean it.

Do not print it :-)
