Lecture 1: February 15, 2023 (2 h)
==================================

- Intro and logistics
- Program (see syllabus)
- Material: Perkins, Longair, Kippenhan and Weigert, Mohapatra, Weinberg,
  Bergstroem and Goodbar, Fermi (Nuclear Physics)

Astrphysics and particles: rotation curves for spiral galaxies, structure of a
galaxy, charachteristic length ~ kp (= 3 ly).

--- Evidences for the existence of dark matter

Newtonian dynamics: naive model of a shpere with constant density + disk with no
mass,  v \propto r inside the bulge and v \propto r ^ -0.5 outside. Observation
does not match -> need to add a halo to have the velocity ~const al large radii

plot -> Rotation curve of NGC 3196
plot -> Abell 2744 (Pandora): mass and light distribution does not match
plot -> Cosmic microwave background, blackbody at 2.725 K, needs to be inserted in
  our model of the universe

Definition of Galactic coordinates, nice drawing!

Anisotropies of the CMB. Decomposition in sherical armonics. Subtract constant,
origin of dipole due to the Earth motion, subtraction of the dipole, and residual
fluctations.

--- CR phenomenology

Experiments with electroscopes, discovery by Hess. Impossible to eliminate: some
ionizing radiation pervades our environment. Natural radioactivity? Not only:
it increase with altitude.

plot -> Kohlhorster experiment

Millikan and experiments under water. Definition of grammage. Cosmic rays were
named by Millikan

plot -> Millikan underwater experiments

1930: discovery of the positron
1947: pions and kaons (quark/antiquark, some decays of interest to us)

Emulsions.

Since the '60 particle Physics switches to accelerators.

plot -> accelerators and energy in the center of mass vs. year. Exponential at the
  beginning, now flattening.

plot -> cosmic-ray spectrum. Interesting: atmospheric neutrinos overlaid! Bilog,
  almost a power law, but a few features: knee at 10^15--16 eV, ankle at 10^19 eV.

plot -> same spectrum, multiplied by E^3

Difference between energy in the center of mass and single particle.

Simple calculation in special relativity, see notes. (Special relativity is given
for granted.) Invariants are independent from the reference system.

LHC = 10^13 ev in CM
UHECR = 10^15 ev in CM (xcheck!!!)

A CR gives the same CM energy as the LHC @ 5e16

CR composition: first measurements with emulsions

plot -> ionization density

plot -> modern chemical composition

Production of antimatter during propagation.

Low-energy cosmic rays: solar modulation at low energy. Differential spectrum
peaking at 300 MeV. We concentrate in high energies, as we are not interested
in solar physics.


--- CR measurements

Nice schematic representation (neutrinos not included)

             Charged                             <->     neutral

heavy        protons, nuclei, pions, muons               neutron
light        electrons                                   photons (x, gamma)

dE/dx for heavy particles, Bethe-Block

x is the reduced length, L \rho. Only depends on beta -> means to identify a
particle if I measure p.

Electrons and radiation losses.

chart -> dependence on Z (Z vs Z^2) and E (ln E vs E)

Critical energy, definition and parametrization.

Photon interactions.

chart -> dependence on A and E, pair production threshold.

EM showers, simple model.



Lecture 2: February 16, 2023 (1 h)
==================================

Definition of the cross section. Look carefully at the derivation, because it
is not very clear.

1 / X = \sigma \rho and interaction length

Conversion between number density and mass density, Avogadro number.

Feynman diagrams for pair production and breemsstralhung. Z^2 dependence and
vertex in the diagram. Similarity of the diagrams, and 7/9, due to the phase
space factor.

Radiation length, simplified model for an EM shower.

Hadronic showers, characteristic scalings.



Lecture 3: February 17, 2023 (2 h)
==================================

--- Ground-based detectors

EAS: working principle, E > 1e14 eV Auger, Argo

Hi altitude (2--3 km), shower maximum at ~10 km altitude, and we want to be as high as
possible, since we only have one sampling. (Counter-example: Gran Sasso, with
EM component on surface and muons underground.)

Sampling in time and position, direction from temporal information with 1 deg accuracy.
Energy from r(600), i.e., signal deposited in a circle of 600 m radius (really?
Only 600 m? Is it possible?). Energy on statistical basis, but ancillary information
(muon and electron components, fluorescence).

Slide about the Auger site. 3000 km^2, 875 g/cm^3, 1400 asl. 1600 water tanks
with 1.5 km spacing, use the Cherenkov effect + fluorescence detectors in
four sites.

---> Add some numbers. Atmosphere interaction length? Typical extension of the
shower? Time resolution?

Cherenkov tanks: water + photomultiplier + readout electronics + GPS, with
antennas to transmit the information. Cherenkov angle in angle is 42 degrees,
mirror on the bottom and one PMT on the top. Explain the need for coincidences.

Example of an event display in Auger.

Also some sensitivity at Z.

Another example: KASKADE in Germany. 200 x 200 m, with 252 detectors + one
central hadronic calorimeter to measure the core of the shower + muon detector.
Showers better measured, but limited in energy on the high end.

---> Investigate the relationship between A and the muon content.

Completely different principle: fluorescence light. N in the atmosphere is
excited by charged particles, and emit radiation at 300--400 nm. Parabolic mirrors
can focus fluorescence light on a pixelized focal plane detector. This images the
entire shower, as opposed to the surface detectors, that sample the shower on a
plane.

Pro: purely calorimetric measurement.

Cons: don't work with bad weather, of with moon, low duty cycle.

Need a nice drawing of fluorescence detectors.

And yet another principle: Cherenkov telescopes, using the Cherencov effect in
air.

Need a nice compilation of all the instruments.


--- Space-based detectors

Small, but very precise measurements. See the CR *before* they interact with the
atmosphere.

Some features:
- limited dimensions (~m)
- determine the charge sign with a magnetic field;
-

Spectrometer: tracker + B, MDR, need TOF to tell upward/downward

p (beta) + dE/dx allows to measure the mass of the particle, i.e., distinguish
protons, pions, and electrons.

Also measure Z -> proton vs. nuclei.

Calorimeter: measure the energy, distinguish EM and hadronic showers.

Pair-conversion telescopes, Fermi. (And CR, and separation of electrons and
positrons with the Earth magnetic field.)

Slides finished. Back to the blackboard.


--- Motion in B

B uniform, helix solution, gyroradius. Definition of rigidity.

Application to a spectrometer, calculate the MDR, 2 TeV with L = 1 m, B = 1 T and sigma = 10 um.
(I suspect that the point can be made in a less involuted way than the one in the
recording. Cross check.)

Another example: a 1 TeV proton from the Sun to the Earth is essentially
undeflected. (B ~ 10 uG).

Another example: gyrofrequency and non relativistic electron in a atom, 21 cm line
and Zeman splitting 29 GHz / T, or 29 Hz at 10 uG. Cannot be seen, but
measuring the polarization allows to map B.

Uniform field -> slowly variable field: adiabatic invariants. In the non relativistic
case for a field that is uniform in space and changes slowly in time, the bottomline
is that the magnetic moment is conserved, or BR^2 is conserved. This is at the
basis of the motion of trapped radiation and magnetic mirrors, and the
Fermi second order acceleration mechanism.



Lecture 4: February 24, 2023 (2 h)
==================================

--- Fermi acceleration of second order

Reflection on magnetic mirrors. Elastic collision in the mirror reference frame,
two Lorentz transformation. Average over the proper cos(theta) distribution.

Calculation of the energy spectrum. (This can be reused later for other mechanisms).

Power law! Cannot predict the index, but can calculate the escape probability.
Acceleration time of the order of 10% of the life of the Universe, way too long.


--- Acceleration of first order

Elements of fluidodynamic. Observables and conservation laws: mass, momentum and
energy.


Lecture 5: March 1, 2023 (2 h)
==============================

Very long introduction about non-relativistic fluidodynamic, with continuity
equation and Euler equation in 3D, and energy conservation in 1D.
Importance of the entalpy.

Example of small perturbations in a fluid and speed of sound. Application to the air.

Full treatment of the first-order acceleration and derivation of the
spectral index.


Lecture 6: March 2, 2023 (1 h)
==============================

Places for acceleration of CR. Galactivc SNR nearby, speed of the shock ~10,000 km/s

- Tycho 1572, SN Ia at 10 kly
- Crab, 1052, SN II
- Kepler, 1603, SN Ia at 20 kly

With charged CR it is hard because they do not proceed in a straight line -> use
neutral. Neutrinos, or pi0 decay in 2 gamma. Science paper by Fermi. Spectral shape
at low energy distinguish bremms from pi0 decay.

--- Energetic balance of CR

Spectrum of CR = 2e4 (E/E0)^-gamma, can integrate between 1 GeV and infty,
multiply by 4pi, E, c (to convert in Energy per cubic m) (see calculation at min 20:00)
= 8e5 eV /m^3, or 1 MeV/m^3

CR contained within our Galaxy by magnetic fields, or cylinder of 10 kp x 700 pc
i.e., 1e61 m^3 for 10^7 years (containment time). If I assume one SNR every 30 years

epsilonCR x VG / t_conf = ESN / TSN

Can calulate ESN, which turns out 5e49 erg, which is about 2% of the energy
in the filaments (1e51 erg).


---Acceleration sites

Hillas plot (1984). SNR can accelerate up to 1e15--16 eV.


--- Acceleration in pulsars

Pulsars, discovered in radio, with periods of ms -> s. Contraction from 1e6 km
to 10 km. In the process B scales as r^-2, i.e., BR^2 is conserved just like
in the adiabatic invariant, although this is not adiabatic. The process is
completely different, but the scaling is the same. The physical reason is that
plasma in this condition is very conductive,

Consider a spira

L di/dt + Ri = -d phi_ext/dt

R = 0 -> phi_i + phi_ext = const, and BR^2 is conserved.

Magnetic field becomes 10^4--10^9 T, pulsating because the axes are not aligned.

Syrovatskii argument: E_max ~ 1e20 eV -> see plot at 39:50. Electric field
created by variation of B (rotation)

4EL = omega / c B L^2

If omega = c / L -> eBL/4


--- AGN and jets

Effetto pinza: v x B pushes toward the inner region.

Starburst galaxies, due to collision between galaxies. Collective SNR much larger.



--- Additional remarks on CR

Balistic vs. diffusion. Gamma 2 -> 2.7 due to diffusion and escape, more probable
at high energy.

Increase of the average mass around the knee. E_cut ~ Ze: protons escape first.

1e18 -> ankle, extra-galactic CR kicking in. Order of magnitude of the gyroradius
vs. galactic radius.

Auger and dipole anisotropy. See the paper. And link with the astrophysical
neutrinos above 1 PeV (2018). One event corresponding to an AGN flare.

Sharp cutoff at 1e20 eV. GZK cutoff.


Lecture 15: March 15, 2023 (1 h)
================================

Universe opaque for high-energy charged particles.

p + gamma -> Delta+ -> N pi

Delta+: hadronic bound state. Cross section is Lorentian (resonance).

sigma ~ 1e28 cm^2

(pp + pgamma)^2 = (mDelta c^2)^2 -> see derivation at 10 min

2(Ep Egamma) (1 - cos theta) = (mdelta^2 - mp^2) c^4

2.7 deg K -> kT = 2.7 /12000 = 1/4000 eV

Threshold for the process is Ep > 4.4e20 eV. Right order of magnitude!


m_pion is 10% of m_p, that is, the p looses 10% of its energy at any
collision, and stops in 10 collision.

lambda = 1/nsigma

n = 400 cm^-3 (CMB)

lambda = 0.25 10^24 cm ~ 10 Mpc

The proton can at maximum travel 10 x 10 = 100 Mpc
